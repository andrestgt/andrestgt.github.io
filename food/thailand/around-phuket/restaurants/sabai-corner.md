A quiet road through lush greenery leads to Sabai Corner, an open-air restaurant with a terrace and sweeping views over Kata and Karon. The setting is the main draw here, and it really is worth the trip for the view alone.

The menu is long and covers the usual Thai standards, with a strong focus on seafood, alongside a number of Western dishes. The food is straightforward and absolutely solid, exactly what you would expect in this kind of place. Nothing particularly memorable, but also nothing to complain about.

Prices are on the higher side, though that’s fairly normal for such a secluded spot with views like these. You are clearly paying in part for the location, but it helps that the food is perfectly decent. Not cheap, but still affordable, and a pleasant place to spend some time.
