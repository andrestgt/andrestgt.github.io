The name is clearly a reference to Singapore’s Lau Pa Sat, but Lao Pa Sat in Phuket Town is a small, modern bistro rather than a hawker centre. It turned out to be my favourite meal in town. The focus is mainly on Singaporean and Malaysian dishes, with a few Thai options alongside.

We had the laksa and the char kway teow, and both were really excellent: rich and well-balanced. Prices are very reasonable and roughly in line with what you’d pay at a hawker centre in Singapore, which makes it good value.
