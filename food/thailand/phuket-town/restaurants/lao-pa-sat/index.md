The name is clearly a reference to Singapore’s Lau Pa Sat, but Lao Pa Sat in Phuket Town is a small, modern bistro rather than a hawker centre. It turned out to be my favourite meal in town. The focus is mainly on Singaporean and Malaysian dishes, with a few Thai options alongside.

We had the laksa and the char kway teow, and both were really excellent: rich, well-balanced, and full of flavour. The laksa had real depth without being overly heavy, while the char kway teow was properly smoky and well seasoned.

Prices are very reasonable and roughly in line with what you’d pay at a hawker centre in Singapore, which makes this place particularly good value given the quality. An easy recommendation and one of the strongest restaurant options in Phuket Town.
