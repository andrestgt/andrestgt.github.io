## One Chun Cafe & Restaurant  
*Phuket Town · Southern Thai · Restaurant*

**Main photo**

If One Chun didn’t carry a Michelin Bib Gourmand recommendation, it would probably register as just another slightly upmarket but otherwise traditional Southern Thai restaurant in Phuket Old Town. That’s not meant negatively. It’s a pleasant place, nicely decorated, with good service and a menu built almost entirely around Thai classics.

The cooking isn’t particularly creative or adventurous, but it’s solid and generally well executed. Prices are not unreasonable for this kind of restaurant, and overall the food is very good. There’s little to complain about, though it’s possible we didn’t order the most interesting dishes on the menu.

The chicken curry was very good. The fish balls were tasty as well, but felt a little bare, coming simply topped with some garlic and little else in the way of herbs or seasoning. The deep-fried eggs were slightly dry.
