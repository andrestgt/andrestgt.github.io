This modern noodle shop specialising in Chinese handmade noodles is a very good option for a quick bowl of noodle soup or a plate of dumplings in Phuket Old Town. The place feels a bit like something you’d stumble across in a Taipei backstreet, simply transplanted into a much more polished setting.

The space is modern, very clean, and nicely decorated, and the food presentation is clearly designed to look good. The menu focuses on simple noodle dishes, dumplings, and soups rather than larger main courses.

Prices are good, especially considering the prime location right in the centre of the old town. It’s an easy, reliable choice when you want something quick, satisfying, and well executed without committing to a full sit-down meal.
