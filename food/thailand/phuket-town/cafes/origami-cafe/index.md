## Origami Café
*Near Bus Station · Café*

Origami is not in the Old Town, but in a rather drab location near the bus station. That might not sound inviting, but it’s worth the short walk. Inside, the café is beautifully decorated and very different from the modern, chic but often uncomfortable hipster cafés in the old town.

The interior is more ornate, with old ceramics and vases, small tables, and a lot of character. It feels genuinely cosy and lived-in rather than designed for Instagram.

They serve good coffee at reasonable prices, and the space is genuinely pleasant to sit in. Even if you’re not catching a bus, Origami is well worth seeking out for a proper coffee break away from the usual Old Town crowd.
