I came across Neng’s Clay Oven Roasted Pork by accident while riding around on my bike in search of a late breakfast. What immediately caught my eye were the clay ovens, with finished roasted chickens and slabs of pork belly stacked on top. It was obvious the place was popular, even though it wasn’t somewhere I had heard of before.

I went back several times. The reason to come is clear: the clay oven–roasted chicken and the roasted pork belly are both excellent, especially when paired with som tam. The meat is properly roasted, flavourful without being heavy, and clearly the result of a setup that knows exactly what it’s doing.

We also tried a few other dishes. Most were fairly simple, but that’s part of the appeal here. Sides like garlicky morning glory worked well alongside the roasted meats and didn’t try to be anything more than they needed to be.

Practical details are handled well. Free drinking water is provided, ordering is easy via QR code, and there are cheap beers if you feel like one. It’s all very straightforward, efficient, and geared towards people who come to eat rather than linger.

Nothing about Neng’s is fancy, but that’s precisely the point. For honest, well-executed food at very reasonable prices, it’s one of my favourite places to eat in Chiang Mai and a clear must-visit.
