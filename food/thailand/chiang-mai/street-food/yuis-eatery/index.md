If heavy rain hadn’t forced us to look for shelter, we probably wouldn’t have found Yui’s Eatery, an unassuming canteen-style place across the river. That would have been a pity, because the food here turned out to be genuinely good.

The menu leans Thai–Chinese, and the dishes we tried were well above what you might expect from such a modest-looking spot. The shrimp wontons tasted very fresh, and the roasted duck was flavourful and juicy, clearly prepared with more care than the average quick meal.

Prices are part of the appeal. Most bowls and plates cost around 50–60 baht, making it excellent value for the quality on offer. It’s not fancy, and it doesn’t try to be, but the cooking easily stands out from standard canteen fare.

There’s an English menu available on request, which makes ordering straightforward even if you’re unfamiliar with the dishes. All in all, a simple, inexpensive place that rewards a bit of accidental discovery.
