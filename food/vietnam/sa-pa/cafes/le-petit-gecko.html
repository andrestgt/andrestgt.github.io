---

Le Petit Gecko might well be Sa Pa’s prettiest café. The space is decorated with a light touch of hill-tribe-inspired elements, surrounded by plants, flowers, and soft colours that make it feel calm and inviting. On looks alone, it’s easy to see why people stop here.

Unfortunately, the coffee does not live up to the setting. I ordered a flat white, which arrived as a bland brown liquid with no foam whatsoever, already partly spilled onto the saucer. At ₫60,000, it wasn’t even cheap by local standards.

I politely asked if they could take it back and remake it as a proper flat white. The response was blunt: this was exactly what a flat white should look like, and they refused to remake it. At that point, there wasn’t much else to say.

It’s a shame, because the café itself has real charm. But when the coffee is this bad — and the attitude this inflexible — the décor becomes irrelevant. For a far safer option, Lê Gecko Café by the lake charges similar prices and at least serves drinkable coffee.
