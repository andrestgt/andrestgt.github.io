Paradise Restaurant has million-dollar views over Fansipan and the surrounding countryside. If you manage to get a seat right on the veranda and order a cold Lao Cai beer, it doesn’t get much better than that.

The food is okay and a bit overpriced — pretty standard for Sa Pa. The spring rolls were actually very good, though, and the fried noodles we had as beer snacks were absolutely fine.

Still, the real reason to come here is the veranda. The views are the main attraction, and they’re genuinely impressive.
