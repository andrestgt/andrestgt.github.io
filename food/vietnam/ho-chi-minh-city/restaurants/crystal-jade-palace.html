Throughout South East Asia, the Crystal Jade name stands for consistently high-quality dumplings, and its only outlet in Vietnam largely lives up to that reputation.

Located inside a five-star hotel, this is a polished and rather formal setting, but the prices for dim sum are surprisingly reasonable. Three people can eat very well for under 500,000 VND, which feels fair given both the quality and the surroundings.

The selection is not as extensive as in some larger Crystal Jade branches elsewhere in the region, but all the expected staples are present. Har gow, siu mai and xiao long bao are all done very well, with clean flavours, good wrappers and reliable execution.

The main drawbacks are practical rather than culinary. Dim sum is only served between 11:00 am and 2:30 pm, which limits flexibility, and the service is attentive to the point of being slightly intrusive. Still, if you’re looking for dependable, well-made dim sum in Ho Chi Minh City, this remains one of the safer choices.
