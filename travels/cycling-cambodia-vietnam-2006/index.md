# Cycling Cambodia & Vietnam  
*03 March – 06 April 2006*


Day 1 – March 3
We arrived in Bangkok in the afternoon and took a taxi to Prince Hotel on New Petchburi Road, which we’d booked from home through a travel agent. Exactly the right kind of place for a single night in Bangkok: close to Sukhumvit, perfectly decent rooms — not new or luxurious, but spacious, with balconies and all the basic comforts — and, at a very modest €12, excellent value. In the evening we went for a walk around Sukhumvit, plunged straight into Bangkok’s wonderfully intoxicating atmosphere, and had dinner at Saw Sam Sai in Soi 20. It’s one of the area’s typical mid-range restaurants, serving straightforward but very tasty Thai food at reasonable prices. We shared a mixed starter platter for two (180 baht), which included shrimp cakes, duck laab and a classic seafood salad. Main dishes at around 100 baht were about five times the price of street food — but the setting was pleasant and the service good.

Day 2 – March 4
In the morning we took an AirAsia flight to Phnom Penh (€20). It was a short flight; the bicycles were transported at no extra charge and arrived without any issues. Visa formalities at the airport were surprisingly quick, and before nine o’clock we were already back on our bikes, cycling the ten kilometres into the city. Traffic in Phnom Penh has increased noticeably in recent years, but the roads have also become wider and better. Official traffic rules do not really exist in Cambodia, of course — yet beneath the apparent chaos there are unwritten rules. If you keep to them and ride in a relaxed but alert way, cycling in Phnom Penh isn't a problem at all. We took a room at River Star Hotel on Sisowath Quay — roughly comparable in standard to the night before, but in a prime spot: spacious, with air-conditioning and TV. The building is already a little past its prime and our room had no window, but at US$20 it was the best room we could find along the riverfront. Since it was Achim’s first time in Phnom Penh, we did the classics: cappuccino at La Croisette; a walk along the riverfront with a light lunch at the small and charming Frizz, where they serve a delicious fish amok (US$4) and an excellent mixed Cambodian barbecue of chicken, beef and fish (US$4 per person); then fresh mango juice (US$2) at Sugar Leaf on Street 240, followed by an hour-long cyclo ride through the city centre. I love Phnom Penh. Ever since my last multi-day stay, I have felt almost at home here. It is at once relaxed and chaotic, endearing and anarchic, run-down and pretty.
The day continued with two-for-one cocktails (US$4.50) on the terrace of the atmospheric colonial FCC building, overlooking the river — expensive but good, and somewhere you really ought to go at least once as a visitor. We carried on at Tamarind, one of my long-standing favourite restaurants. This time the service was a bit off — the tapas, however, are still excellent. And then, as a deliberate contrast — Phnom Penh is, after all, a city of contrasts — we had dinner at a local open-air place without an English sign on Sothearos Boulevard, diagonally opposite the Silver Pagoda. Here we drank cheap Angkor beer by the pitcher (6,500 riel) and sampled rustic fare such as bull’s testicles, duck’s feet and tripe soup, priced between 3,000 and 10,000 riel. I wish I could say it was all surprisingly delicious — but that would be a lie. It was fine for the laugh, but I much prefer the tapas at Tamarind. We had our nightcap at Riverside, my favourite café on Sisowath Quay.

Day 3 – March 5 (48 km)
Today we were properly riding for the first time and headed out to the Killing Fields of Choeung Ek, well out in the countryside beyond the city. Phnom Penh’s main roads are now in very good shape, but the final stretch to the memorial is a rough, dusty back road. Since I’d already visited the far less touristy Killing Field near Battambang six years ago, the sight of the Khmer Rouge’s bones and rags was nothing new to me — and yet you still can’t really grasp what must have happened here, not so very long ago. What was shocking too, unfortunately, was the number of package tourists and the thoughtless idiocy with which they handed out money and sweets to the begging children. On the way back into town we took a slightly different route and approached from the south along the river, then recovered with a refreshing pomelo-and-mint juice in the wonderfully shady garden of Boddhi Tree opposite S-21. After yesterday’s Dolce Vita, today was more sobering — because that, too, is Cambodia. The former Khmer Rouge prison and interrogation centre is a disturbing place, full of images that stay with you, both on the walls and in your head as you walk through the cells. As a counterbalance we then cycled quietly through Phnom Penh’s pretty, calm villa district south of Independence Monument and went for lunch at Malis, which, although new, already seems to be one of the most talked-about restaurants in the city. It’s easy to see why. Even though it’s not on the promenade but on the unremarkable Norodom Boulevard, Malis is the most stylish place in town: a blend of Asian tradition and big-city chic, with superbly comfortable sofa lounges, individual air-con at the tables, and excellent service, all set in a garden that is beautifully designed both architecturally and aesthetically. And the food? Outstanding — refined Khmer cooking with a few fresh touches, perfectly prepared, beautifully presented, generous portions, and all at surprisingly fair, genuinely reasonable prices. The scallops (US$4.90) and prawn cakes (US$4.90) were excellent; the aubergine-and-crab salad (US$6.60) was a revelation, as was the steamed goby in ginger sauce (US$4.10). Only the duck curry fell slightly short — very good, but ultimately a traditional Khmer-style curry and rather light on the meat (US$5.10). Malis is certainly one of Phnom Penh’s culinary highlights — if not the highlight. We spent the hottest hours of the day napping in the air-conditioned hotel room, and only went back out in the evening. We had a small meal at the newly opened Pakistani place on Street 104 and went straight to bed again; jet lag and the change in climate were taking their toll. Dinner, though, was excellent. Kabab Shop is a tiny hole-in-the-wall place with an oven out front producing authentically Pakistani food: chicken tikka masala and lamb koftas for us, plus fresh garlic naan and mango lassi. With prices between US$3 and US$4 it isn’t exactly dirt-cheap, but it was a fine change for the palate.

Day 4 – March 6 (130 km)
Phnom Penh – Kampong Cham

Today the tour finally began in earnest — and immediately with a long ride of over 130 kilometres. We left Phnom Penh via Friendship Bridge, and after only ten kilometres the traffic thinned noticeably. The “highway” — even Cambodia’s main routes are little more than country roads — ran through classic countryside: green rice fields and coconut palms; and the further we got from Phnom Penh, the fewer solid houses we saw, with wooden huts lining the road instead. Supplies are never a problem: every few hundred metres you can stock up on water, fruit, or delicious sugarcane juice. The tropical heat didn’t bother me either. We stopped for lunch in the small market town of Skuon and, since the place is famous for its fried spiders, that was of course what I ate. It was perfectly fine — nice and crisp — but not exactly filling. After Skuon the riding became a little more tiring because of roadworks and a few small climbs, but overall cycling in Cambodia seems straightforward and unproblematic. As a foreigner on a bicycle, though, you are a major attraction and instantly the centre of attention wherever you happen to be. Our stage finish, Kampong Cham, is a friendly, relaxed provincial town on the Mekong, with a few crumbling French colonial buildings and Chinese shophouses. People here still seem genuinely nice and curious — a clear sign that not many tourists pass through. There was a good hotel too: Mekong on the riverside road, a relatively new building in a striking bright-yellow faux-colonial style. The US$10 rooms were simply furnished but new and clean, with air-con and a fine river view. Kampong Cham isn’t blessed on the culinary front — there are very few restaurants — but the meal at Hoa An, apparently popular with the few tourists who do make it here, was perfectly fine. The shrimp beignets (8,500 riel) were good, as was the beef (8,500 riel). The steamed fish tasted slightly of river (15,000 riel), but it came with a delicious ginger sauce.

Day 5 – March 7 (124 km)
Kampong Cham – Tay Ninh

We left Kampong Cham via the huge new Mekong bridge and followed Highway 7 for another sixty kilometres or so in the direction of Kratie — an enjoyable ride on decent tarmac with only a few small hills. In the village of Krek we turned right towards the Vietnamese border. This crossing had only been opened to tourists in January, and the Cambodians clearly hadn’t had time to build a proper road: first gravel, later dust and potholes. After only fifteen kilometres we reached the Vietnamese border — and the road from there to our destination, Tay Ninh, was excellent. Where Cambodia and Vietnam were still fairly similar in terms of development only a few years ago, the difference today is enormous — and not just in road quality. On the Cambodian side, border officials work in small tin huts; in Vietnam there is a solid building. Roadside cafés have electricity, sometimes even refrigerators, whereas in Cambodia you mostly see generators and cool boxes stuffed with blocks of ice. Even the chairs are far more comfortable. Vietnam has a proper café culture, even deep in the provinces where tourists almost never stray. Prices still seemed very low, and every drink comes with a complimentary pot of iced tea. The remaining stretch to Tay Ninh was pancake-flat and, apart from a few short sections with roadworks, fast and easy. Tay Ninh felt fairly prosperous: a modern provincial city with broad boulevards and many new shopfronts — a pleasant enough place with nice street cafés, though not much charm otherwise. We took a room at Anh Dao Hotel. It was a bit worn, but spacious, reasonably clean and good value at 140,000 dong — more than enough for a night. Our first meal in Vietnam, a genuine gourmet paradise, immediately made us want more. Even though Than Thuy was a simple, standard place, “standard” in Vietnam is a pleasure. There was no English menu; we ordered more or less at random and ended up with, among other things, a very fine beef hotpot with good-quality meat — for very little money.

Day 6 – March 8 (102 km)
Tay Ninh – Cu Chi – Saigon

Today we followed Highway 22 a hundred kilometres into Saigon. A virtually flat stage and very easy riding. For the first forty kilometres the road was quite narrow and there were some roadworks with gravel. From Go Dau onwards, though, it became a multi-lane superhighway with a broad shoulder and, until about ten kilometres before Saigon, little traffic — we made rapid progress. Scenically, the route offered little, but shortly before Go Dau there was a beautiful garden café with Asian pavilions surrounded by lotus ponds. Riding into central Saigon was an adventure: an adrenaline-charged rollercoaster in the middle of hundreds of thousands of two-wheelers apparently streaming in all directions without any plan. I’ve rarely had that much fun. Cycling here is an experience; even crossing the street as a pedestrian is always a small adventure.
We checked into the same hotel as six years ago, Giant Dragon in the Phạm Ngũ Lão tourist quarter. As so often with cheap hotels in Asia, rooms age quickly, and Giant Dragon could really do with a fresh coat of paint — especially since the price is still US$25. But the rooms are very comfortable for a budget hotel: spacious, tasteful, and worth the money. Around Phạm Ngũ Lão there now seem to be hundreds of hotels and guesthouses; competition is huge, and I can’t imagine occupancy rates are especially high. Saigon is certainly more touristy now than it was in 2000 — but it’s still nothing like Bangkok. In the afternoon we had lunch at Bao around the corner from the hotel, on recommendation. A typical, simple street place with a first-floor veranda from which you could watch — and hear — the chaos down on the street. The food was excellent, and despite the tourist-area location the clientele was exclusively Vietnamese. Prices were a little higher than you might expect for a place like this, but still very cheap for the quality. We only had a few small things: spring rolls (30,000 d), snails (25,000 d), and two excellent chicken dishes — steamed (40,000 d) and wings (25,000 d). The food alone is worth a trip to Vietnam. We spent the rest of the day more or less aimlessly walking through the centre. I could hardly remember Saigon, but it was obvious that the city has changed in the last six years like few others. Modern high-rises are mushrooming; smart shopping centres, cafés and bars for the steadily growing middle and upper classes are everywhere. Back then I wrote that Saigon, despite its size, felt more like an oversized village. That doesn’t apply at all anymore. It’s now a full-blown metropolis, with all the advantages and disadvantages that come with it — though there still aren’t many cars. We had dinner at the small, pleasant Restaurant 13 right in the business and first-class hotel quarter. Most of the guests were Westerners, but prices were still moderate and the food was standard Vietnamese — and very tasty. We only had a few small things: shrimp spring rolls (26,000 dong), gỏi cuốn, the fresh version (8,000 dong), and sizzling garlic squid (40,000 dong). All good, all cheap.

Day 7 – March 9

Today we left the bikes at the hotel and let others do the pedalling. We started with breakfast — phở at Bến Thành Market, which offered plenty of worthwhile photo opportunities. Afterwards we took a long walk through District 3 — quiet and relaxed by Saigon standards — to Jade Emperor Pagoda, probably one of the most picturesque among the city’s many fine pagodas. District 3 has a few pleasant cafés, such as Café des Amis, which seem to cater mainly to wealthier locals. It’s a very likeable neighbourhood. From there we hired cyclos (25,000 dong per hour) and let ourselves be ferried gently through the traffic to the former Chinese quarter of Chợ Lớn, walked through the interesting market there, and rode back again — past countless pagodas and typical Chinese shop houses, which are not exactly a triumph of aesthetics. It was a pleasure to sit on a bicycle — or rather in front of a bicycle — and have nothing to do. We got dropped off at Quán Ăn Ngon for lunch. It’s not only one of the best-known and most popular places in the city, but also one of the prettiest: spread over two floors in a beautifully renovated colonial villa, with open kitchens on the ground floor turning out street-food classics. The crowd is completely mixed — locals young and old, luxury and budget tourists — and the place itself is just as eclectic: elegant setting, simple seating, clever, delicious cooking, and low prices. Again we only ordered small dishes so we could try as many places and flavours as possible: tôm hấp nước dừa (60,000 d), gỏi bò (40,000 d), and gỏi sò huyết (40,000 d). And yes — it tasted as good as it sounds. In the afternoon we explored the centre again on foot in daylight. Saigon is a special city: not beautiful, but far from unpleasant; not a place you’d instantly fall in love with — and yet so full of life and pleasures that you can’t help being drawn to it, even though it has nothing cosy about it, unlike Bangkok or Hà Nội. We found a street stall with delicious, cheap fruit juices on Nguyễn Thái Bình. The fresh strawberry juice (7,000 d) was a revelation; the durian juice (9,000 d) too. We took an aperitif at Café Latin: good cocktails (65,000 d) and comfortable sofas, but otherwise a typical expat hangout — rather steep prices, no locals, and too many screens with dull sports TV on the walls. To get to the place I’d chosen for dinner we had to head back into District 3. It was a long trek up Pasteur Street, quite a way from the city centre, but this area has a number of open-air places that look very inviting and are frequented almost exclusively by locals. I’d picked Huong Dong because it’s known for unusual meat dishes; at the entrance we were greeted by an iguana on the grill. Still, the real highlights were the “standard” dishes, prepared to exceptionally high standards. The roasted pigeon (45,000 dong) and the grilled field mouse (50,000 d) were good — but the absolute stars were the homemade sesame-coated spring rolls (60,000 d) and the raw fish in rice-paper wraps (90,000 d). Prices are high for Saigon, but even here, with drinks, we paid only €15 between the two of us for four dishes — our most expensive meal so far.

Day 8 — 10 March — 104 km
Saigon — Mỹ Tho — Bến Tre — Mỹ Tho

Getting out of Saigon was far less frantic than yesterday’s ride in. The western exit road towards Highway 1 was wide enough to hold your line without being constantly squeezed. Highway 1 itself isn’t particularly pretty, but it’s fast: a broad shoulder, excellent surface, and steady progress, so we rolled into Mỹ Tho—gateway to the Delta—by lunchtime.
We took a room at the Rang Dong Hotel, a typical, slightly timeworn mini-hotel. The room showed its age, but it was spacious, clean, and had the usual comforts (air-con, fridge, TV) for a bargain 130,000 dong. With plenty of day left, we grabbed a quick bite at Chi Tanh, a simple little hole-in-the-wall place by the park. Delta staples at Delta prices: crab cooked two ways—grilled and in a lovely tamarind sauce (60,000 dong each)—and, unexpectedly, very tender beef in black-bean sauce (20,000 dong). Afterwards we took the ferry across into Bến Tre Province and did a short loop into the town of Bến Tre itself. It was a good decision, because it offered a glimpse of what the Delta may look like if modernisation keeps moving at this speed. In this quiet, untouristed corner, a four-lane highway is being driven straight through the fields—parts of it already finished. It will replace the charming little lane that currently runs past coconut palms and wooden huts. Before Bến Tre, an enormous new boulevard with big junctions and rows of shopfronts has been built from scratch—logical enough if one day cars really do replace the motorbikes. For locals this kind of progress may well mean a better quality of life; for visitors it chips away at the Delta’s old-world charm. I’m curious how far this ‘future’ has already reached other provinces, and how much traditional atmosphere will be left. Back in Mỹ Tho we explored the town itself. Guidebooks often dismiss it as dull—a place to stop briefly before jumping straight on a boat—but I didn’t find it unattractive at all. The locals were friendly, a few crumbling colonial buildings still stand here and there, the river promenade is looked after, and the ramshackle huts on the bank and the boats on the river make for wonderfully photogenic scenes. It seems day-trippers really don’t spend time in town, because I didn’t see another Westerner all evening. Dinner was at Song Tien, a big open-air place with pavilion seating and a slightly ‘hotel’ feel, but the food was very good and cheap. We had spring rolls (20,000 dong), grilled squid (25,000 dong), and a Mekong speciality: elephant-ear fish served whole, with the sweet flesh wrapped in rice paper with herbs and vegetables (50,000 dong). Only the beef with mushrooms (20,000 dong) was a touch chewy—hardly a tragedy in a feast that, drinks included, came in at under €8.

Day 9 — 11 March — 90 km
Mỹ Tho — Sa Đéc

Yesterday’s worries turned out to be unfounded. Even if modernisation is in full swing, it will clearly take a long time before progress has completely trumped traditional charm in the Delta’s back corners. We left Mỹ Tho westwards on a lovely little lane along a branch of the Tieu River. The farther we rode from town, the more ‘old Delta’ it felt. After 30 kilometres the tarmac ended, but we stayed on the narrow, sometimes bumpy track heading towards Cái Bè. The bridges along the way were genuinely adventurous—narrow, rickety, with no side rails—and we even had a crossing on an almost prehistoric ferry. This really is still an untouched patch of Delta, and I doubt many tourists ever come here. Cái Bè, reached after another fifteen-odd kilometres, is a different story. It’s a well-known stop thanks to its floating market, and coachloads of visitors are shipped in and put straight onto boats. Almost none of them seem to look at the town itself or the big market on land, which felt strikingly authentic—and also visibly poor. In any case, we and our bicycles were a sensation. We stopped for lunch at Restaurant Number One just past Cái Bè on the spur road to Highway 1: a classic open-air local place with pavilion seating and standard Delta cooking. Again, everything was excellent apart from the inevitable slightly tough beef. In the Delta it really pays to stick to fish, poultry, and seafood—the cooking is almost always clever, refined, and delicious. Here that meant grilled prawns (50,000 dong), mussels (20,000 dong), and a hotpot (30,000 dong). The next twenty kilometres on Highway 1 were dull but quick, and soon we were over a huge bridge across a broad river. On the far side we turned right towards Sa Đéc. The last fifteen kilometres into town were the opposite of relaxing: narrow, dusty, busy, and peppered with crater-sized potholes. In Sa Đéc we checked into the Hong Bong Hotel—probably the best address in town—with spacious modern rooms, a lift, a big balcony, and the usual kit (air-con, TV, fridge). It seemed to belong to the regional tourism authority, and incredibly they still ran an old-style two-tier pricing system: locals paid one rate, foreigners another. Still, 16 dollars for the standard was fair. Sa Đéc is one of those Delta towns that foreign tourists rarely overnight in—I didn’t see a single one on an evening walk—yet it’s a friendly, attractive place. There’s a lively riverside market, and across the water you can see splendid old colonial villas, some used by Jean-Jacques Annaud as locations for L’Amant. Sa Đéc has real charm. We ended up eating twice because our first choice, a Lonely Planet recommendation, was disappointing. Thuy, a tiny ‘hole-in-the-wall’ place (the author clearly has a thing for them), was cheap and the food was fine—fried fish Vietnamese-style (25,000 dong) and something undefined translated as ‘black pudding’ that tasted better than it sounded (15,000 dong). But the service was dreadful: bored, unfriendly, and the portions for foreigners noticeably smaller than those for locals. So we trusted our own noses and found Restaurant 125 by the canal: friendly, no English menu, and the thickest, juiciest frog legs I’ve ever eaten (20,000 dong), plus eel in satay sauce (20,000 dong). The beef luc lac was merely average, but the prices were rock-bottom.

Day 10 — 12 March — 105 km
Sa Đéc — Chợ Mới — Châu Đốc

The first 50 kilometres, out past Chợ Mới, were a scenic run along the quiet, narrow Route 848 beside the Tieu River, through an area that—by Delta standards—felt almost sparsely populated. The road was easy and mostly in good shape, though a few construction sites slowed us down. We stopped for lunch in the small market town of Chợ Mới at the friendly roadside Restaurant 999. They pulled eel straight from a tank and served it along with prawns (with rice paper and herbs for wrapping) and squid. Eating outside the tourist towns always comes with an element of surprise: menus are rarely translated, so we tend to order by educated guesswork. Prices are seldom listed either, but so far that hasn’t mattered—things have almost always been cheaper than we expected. Here the ‘standard range’ was 20,000–50,000 dong. Beyond Chợ Mới we ferried over to Phu My and followed the left bank towards Châu Đốc. This little tarmac lane was the most picturesque stretch of the whole trip so far: cliché-perfect tropical scenery—rice fields, wooden huts, waving locals—and almost no traffic. A genuinely lovely, rarely visited corner of the Delta. Unfortunately, after about fifteen kilometres the tarmac ended, so we crossed again by ferry to Cai Dau and took the remainder to Châu Đốc on the main Road 91 on the right bank. Less charming, but excellent riding, and the last 25 kilometres flew by on fresh surface. In Châu Đốc we took a room in what must be the most central hotel in town, the nearly new Trung Nguyen. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the market and was modern and comfortable, if a little compact—still perfectly good value at 15 dollars. Châu Đốc is one of the Delta’s main tourist hubs and, despite sitting right on the Cambodian border, feels surprisingly prosperous. It’s an attractive place, with a smart new river promenade looking out over floating houses on the Bassac, and more crumbling colonial buildings than you see in many other Delta towns. A particular joy here is the fruit-shake stalls: I have no idea what their secret is, but they were among the best I’ve ever had—mango, pineapple, jackfruit—delicious and cheap (6,000 dong). Dinner was a hit too. In a courtyard surrounded by splendid colonial ambience opposite the upmarket Victoria Resort, we found the Restaurant Mekong—essentially a big, simple street kitchen with basic seating and almost entirely local customers. It’s a minor miracle the place still exists in such modest form in this location. You could watch the cooking, and the woman at the grill plainly knows what she’s doing. We had spring rolls (25,000 dong), prawns with rice paper (40,000 dong), eel salad (35,000 dong) and an astonishingly generous fish hotpot for a laughably low 45,000 dong.

Day 11 — 13 March — 123 km
Châu Đốc — Tri Tôn — Núi Sập — Rạch Giá

We left Châu Đốc heading south, skirting Pagoda-covered Mount Sam, a major pilgrimage spot, especially for Vietnamese visitors. We’d already enjoyed the views from the summit six years ago, so we spared ourselves the slog up. Beyond Mount Sam, Highway 91 narrowed and grew rougher, running along a sort of embankment between canals, past simple stilt houses and close to the Cambodian border. This feels like one of the least developed—and poorest—regions of southern Vietnam. Without the power lines, you could almost believe you’d slipped back into Cambodia. At Nha Bang we turned onto Route 948 towards Tri Tôn, and for a brief moment left the Delta’s flatness behind: two small passes, nothing dramatic, and on a decent road easily managed. Before the market town of Tri Tôn it flattened out again. From here we entered genuine tourist no-man’s-land, even though the canal road towards Núi Sập was very good riding. Westerners probably turn up in this remote area only rarely, and I felt a bit like a creature from another planet. Cyclists in Vietnam are always an attraction, but out here—so far off the beaten track—it was on another level. The most atmospheric, and perhaps the most enjoyable, stretch of the whole trip came between Núi Sập and the coastal city of Rạch Giá. A track made of laterite slabs—just wide enough for two-wheelers—followed a canal, sometimes on one bank, sometimes on the other, with tiny ferries shuttling you across for 1,000 dong. It was the sort of scene tourists imagine the Mekong Delta to be: pretty wooden houses, friendly locals, busy river life, cafés along the way—except this was the real thing, and we were the only tourists. The only downside was the last ten kilometres, where the canal track deteriorated into a bumpy dirt lane on both sides. After nearly 120 kilometres already in the legs, it dragged. Rạch Giá looks like a comparatively well-off port city, with many new buildings and broad streets. Most visitors are here for one reason: the ferry to Phú Quốc. We took a room at the very new-looking Wild Rose Hotel, right in the centre by the canal. Excellent value. For 150,000 dong our room was a bit small and only had one bed (the suites were taken), but it was modern, immaculate, and well-equipped. As it was already late and we hadn’t eaten yet, we went to Hong Phat, the nearest Lonely Planet recommendation. Once again it turned out to be a half-empty ‘hole-in-the-wall’ with an English menu and surly service—hard to understand when there are so many cheerful open-air places full of locals all over town. The food was fine, but by Vietnamese standards underwhelming and oddly Chinese-leaning. The fried prawns (25,000 dong) were good, but the squid (20,000 dong) came in a bland, herb-free sauce that would be almost unthinkable elsewhere in Vietnam. Cheap, but not worth hunting down.

Day 12 — 14 March — 34 km
Phú Quốc

At eight we took the Sea Bird to Phú Quốc, after an iced coffee at the beautiful Café Garden on the road to the pier. This is the best ferry to the island: you can sit outside, and for just 160,000 dong you get first-class seats upstairs. About two and a half hours later we arrived in An Thới, at Phú Quốc’s southern tip, and cycled straight towards Dương Đông, the island’s main town and tourist centre. The first six kilometres were tarmacked but hilly. Then we turned onto a gorgeous dirt track that runs right along a kilometre-long sandy beach lined with coconut palms. There was virtually no traffic; this part of the island is still completely undeveloped—no resorts, just a few fishermen’s huts and boats on the sand, and more cows on the road than cars. At the only beach restaurant around, the wonderful and very simple Cam Loan, 12 kilometres south of Dương Đông, we ate an excellent seafood hotpot with a view of the beach and fishing boats rocking offshore. A generous pot with prawns, octopus, and fish in a tasty broth cost 100,000 dong. Around three kilometres south of Dương Đông, where the road leaves the coast and runs a little inland through low hills, we took a bungalow at Lam Ha Resort. At 12 dollars it was a steal: new, spacious, with a big bathroom, a veranda, air-con, and a small garden outside. The only drawback was being in the second row, about 100 metres from Long Beach—perfectly fine for a single night. After a short walk on the sand we cycled into Dương Đông. The bustling little ‘capital’ is genuinely interesting: a photogenic fishing fleet, a big market, and—right on its doorstep—the island’s crown jewel, the 20-kilometre Long Beach. The beach really is superb. The southern stretches are quiet and unspoilt, though not quite as breathtaking as the section just south of Dương Đông. Here, where several resorts already stand and more are being built, Long Beach delivers proper tropical postcard scenery: white sand and coconut palms. The worry is the developers’ grandiose ambitions; I’d read there are already plans for a ‘second Phuket’ in some investor’s drawer. For now, tourism is still fairly gentle and—crucially—the resorts at least clear
away the rubbish that piles up on the sand, something the undeveloped stretches don’t benefit from. Whatever the island’s future, Phú Quốc is absolutely worth the detour now (and probably for the next few years), not least for the dreamy sunset we watched through the palms from the Seastar Resort veranda. For sundowners you want to be on a beachfront veranda; for dinner, the best restaurant on the island sits, inconveniently, on the road south of Dương Đông. The French owner of Carole has made the most of the location: candlelight on sand under bamboo umbrellas, and a level of Franco-Vietnamese cooking that’s genuinely refined—at very fair prices. The Vietnamese seafood salad (40,000 dong) was delicious, as were the oyster brochettes (50,000 dong) and a whole grilled ‘Sapa’ fish (100,000 dong). Service was a little clumsy, but portions were generous. Highly recommended—we’d have returned more than once if we’d stayed longer.
Day 13 — 15 March — 79 km
Phú Quốc — Rạch Giá — Tan Hiep
To get back to An Thới we took the island’s main road through the lush green interior. It’s a narrow, single-lane strip—and, remarkably, still the only paved road on Phú Quốc. A lovely ride through lightly populated countryside, with some fairly hilly stretches. You can detour to springs with pools for swimming, though that’s really only worthwhile in the rainy season; at the moment they hold hardly any water. Much more rewarding was the turn-off to Bãi Sao, a beautiful bay with genuinely white sand and palms that give the right tropical mood. The three-kilometre spur road is steep and rough, but there’s a beach restaurant at the end where you can refuel. For Vietnamese visitors this seems to be a popular day-trip spot, despite prices that are high by local standards. Still, the fat ‘lobster crabs’ (90,000 dong) and fish grilled in foil (90,000 dong) were excellent—and eating seafood with a view of sand, palms, and sea always tastes better. Bãi Khem, apparently the island’s finest beach, was unfortunately off limits: the navy told us it’s currently closed to civilians. I slept through almost the entire ferry ride back to Rạch Giá. When we arrived in the afternoon it was the first time we’d had proper rain all trip. Once it eased, we cycled down to the bus terminal seven kilometres south of town to arrange transport to Cần Thơ. The only bus at that time refused to take our bicycles at the normal fare, so we changed plans on the spot and simply carried on by bike along the canal on Highway 80.
It was already dark when we reached Tan Hiep, the first larger place with somewhere to sleep. Western tourists clearly don’t end up stranded here often: our arrival was an event. The family at our guesthouse, Tung, treated us like honoured guests—fried noodles with seafood (30,000 dong), spring rolls (30,000 dong), and fried prawns (40,000 dong). The room was perfectly fine too: simple, with one bed and a squat toilet, but brand new and spotless (120,000 dong). It was lovely to spend a night in a provincial town far from any well-worn tourist trail.
Day 14 — 16 March — 87 km
Tan Hiep — Cần Thơ
Today’s ride—thirty-odd kilometres north on Highway 80 followed by fifty kilometres into the wind on Highway 91 to Cần Thơ—was uneventful. Despite heavy traffic, the road is decent and perfectly rideable. The landscape along the highway is densely settled, so you don’t get much rural idyll here. I reached Cần Thơ by midday and found us a simple but clean room with the usual comforts for 180,000 dong at the little Hotel So 10, tucked down a side lane off the riverfront road. For lunch we went to Nam Bo, the most popular tourist place in town, set in a restored colonial building with a first-floor balcony overlooking the river and promenade. The menu mixes Vietnamese and Western dishes; we stayed Vietnamese: a snake set menu with spring rolls and snake curry (69,000 dong), plus fish baked in a clay pot (40,000 dong). For the ambience, the prices were pleasantly moderate. In the afternoon we took a long walk through Cần Thơ. Despite being the Mekong Delta’s largest city, it’s a fairly calm, agreeable place, with a nice riverside park and a big, lively market. Only the café culture feels a bit underdeveloped for a city of this size. For dinner we had even better views of river life than from Nam Bo’s balcony—because we ate on the enormous floating restaurant Du Thuyen moored in front of the promenade. Apart from us, everyone was Vietnamese (always a good sign), though the service was terrible. The food, however, was excellent—especially the thick grilled lobsters, and you didn’t even need to rob a bank to pay for them (four for 175,000 dong). Also very good was a salad of green mango with dried snakehead fish (55,000 dong).
Day 15 — 17 March — 13 km
To round off and conclude our Mekong Delta loop, we went out this morning on a long-tail boat to see the Cái Răng floating market and the quiet canals around Cần Thơ from the water. Cycling is the perfect way to explore the Delta in depth, but the real highlight of any Delta trip is time in these little long-tails: suddenly you’re in it rather than watching it, right in the bustle of the floating markets and on the tropical green waterways. In Cần Thơ a boat costs only 3 dollars an hour—money well spent, even for cyclists. After a slightly late breakfast at the pretty So Tom restaurant on the promenade (mango juice and fresh spring rolls), it was time to say goodbye to the Mekong and take the minibus back to Saigon. We had to pay for five seats (two for us, three for the bikes), but the trip in a modern, air-conditioned van was quick—four hours, 60,000 dong—and comfortable. Back in Hồ Chí Minh City we first had to get from the bus terminal in Chợ Lớn, about ten kilometres outside the centre, into town—a joyride through scooter chaos. We stayed again in Phạm Ngũ Lão, but for this one night chose a cheaper room: 15 dollars at Huynh Anh, a fairly large modern hotel with a lift and well-equipped rooms, though the bathroom was a bit small. We bought our tickets for tomorrow’s hydrofoil to Vũng Tàu at the pier and, since we were in the area anyway, paid another visit to Bo Tung Xeo—still wildly popular, packed with locals, and the place where we ate our very first meal in Vietnam six years ago. Its reputation is still deserved: the food remains superb and the prices are as moderate as ever. The house speciality, Bo Tung Xeo (marinated beef BBQ, 75,000 dong), is heavenly; the fresh oysters (10,000 dong each) are huge; and even the salmon sashimi (40,000 dong) tasted just as good as back then. With all that on offer, it’s no surprise we once again skipped the goat penis listed on the menu.
Day 16 — 18 March — 85 km
Saigon — Vũng Tàu — Bình Châu
The plan sounded perfect: an early-morning hydrofoil to Vũng Tàu, then a relaxed 80-kilometre ride to the hot springs at Bình Châu, arriving by early afternoon to be pampered in the resort. Unfortunately, on the boat I realised our hotel had forgotten to return our passports at checkout. So after arriving in Vũng Tàu, grabbing a coffee, and getting a puncture fixed (patching an inner tube for 5,000 dong), I had to take the ferry back to Saigon, ride to the hotel, collect the passports, and then take the hydrofoil to Vũng Tàu all over again. Luckily the boats run hourly, take only about 90 minutes, and are cheap (120,000 dong per person plus 50,000 dong for the bike). Still, it’s not a trip you’d choose to do three times in one day.
By the time I could finally continue cycling it was half past one. A lightly trafficked four-lane road took me across the Vũng Tàu peninsula to Ba Ria, where—just to add to the fun—I took the wrong exit and ended up on Route 52 instead of Route 55. Not disastrous, as the road was pleasant, but it added another ten kilometres. When I finally reached Highway 55 it was already half three, with Bình Châu still 40 kilometres away. The road was decent, with little traffic, and mostly flat to gently rolling. The surface started out excellent but deteriorated steadily; the last 15 kilometres were quite bumpy. We arrived at the resort at dusk, so the ‘wellness programme’ had to wait until morning. The resort is a real oasis in the middle of nowhere. Our suite was spacious—almost luxurious—with a great bathroom and a big tub. The package price of 49 dollars for two people included breakfast buffet, a private pool for thermal and mud baths, tennis, fishing, and—best of all—four eggs to cook yourself in an 82°C hot spring pool. Compared with what European spa resorts charge, this is basically free; you could even get a massage for about €2 an hour. Dinner in the restaurant was fine, very much ‘Vietnam with Vietnamese’ (we were the only Western guests). We had spring rolls (34,000 dong) and tasty grilled squid (45,000 dong) at reasonable prices. The seafood hotpot, however, was overpriced at 130,000 dong—decent, but not quite living up to its potential.
Day 17 — 19 March — 110 km
Bình Châu — La Gi — Phan Thiết
We made full use of our wellness vouchers from six to nine, and worked our way through the modest breakfast buffet. The eggs cooked in the hot spring were genuinely fun—and oddly ‘reverse-cooked’: the yolk sets before the white. In any case, fully relaxed, we rode back to Route 55, which was quiet, gently hilly, and—thanks to the wind—harder than it should have been. This is another region where you see almost no Western tourists, which makes café stops ‘interesting’: half the village’s teenagers gather around you as if you’ve landed from space. Route 55 eventually fed into Highway 1, which we followed for almost 50 kilometres to Phan Thiết. Vietnam’s main north–south artery is actually excellent for cycling: mostly fresh surface, wide shoulder, and steady progress. The terrain was only lightly rolling today; the wind was the real opponent. According to Lonely Planet, Phan Thiết isn’t necessarily worth a visit. I liked it a lot. The evening atmosphere is terrific: a photogenic fishing fleet on the river, improvised street kitchens, a surprising number of stylish cafés and seafood restaurants by the pleasant town beach. European tourists rarely overnight here, and the locals are extremely friendly—in our restaurant, the simple Thuy Phuong, we were the main attraction. There was no English menu, so I simply chose our meat from the fridge. We ended up with a whole grilled squid (50,000 dong) and a goat stew (40,000 dong) that was delicious—very like a Thai tom yum soup. Our room was as basic and cheap as it gets—Hoang Anh Mini-hotel on the northern exit road—but for 140,000 dong we still had air-con and a fridge. The room was old-fashioned but very spacious and absolutely clean.
Day 18 — 20 March — 43 km
Phan Thiết — Mũi Né
When I woke up this morning it was obvious the cold that had been threatening finally had me. Luckily today’s plan was only a short hop to Mũi Né—about all I could face. Air-conditioning, as pleasant as it feels, is a slightly treacherous thing in the tropics. After coffee on Phan Thiết’s beach we rode over a headland on a hilly road; from kilometre 10 of the coastal road it flattened out along the sea. This is where Mũi Né’s beach begins: endless sand lined with palms, and almost as many resorts and restaurants—some right on the beach, others on the road behind. The best stretch is between kilometres 12 and 15, where the tourist infrastructure is densest. Even so, Mũi Né feels calm and laid-back: no high-rises, and tourists—Vietnamese and Western alike—spread out along the long beach. Somewhat surprisingly, given the sheer amount of competition, hotel prices are high by Vietnamese standards. We were early and looked at several places, but the value was poor—and it wasn’t a weekend or holiday. In the end we found a very decent bungalow at the Vietnam-Austria House: a bit old-school, but superbly located right on the beach, spacious, with air-con, veranda, and a large bathroom. The resort itself isn’t the prettiest and feels a bit cramped between bungalows, pool, and main building, but it sits on one of the best parts of the beach, and 25 dollars was fair for Mũi Né. The main ‘problem’ here is the wind. It’s perfect for surfers, but for sunbathing and long walks it can be relentless. Still, the beach is genuinely attractive—wide and seemingly endless. We had breakfast at Mango Restaurant, one of the few independent places directly on the sand. They serve simple Vietnamese and Western dishes, with lots of seafood. Food in Mũi Né is surprisingly cheap compared with accommodation. A whole grilled grouper with firm flesh cost 60,000 dong; noodles with mixed seafood, 25,000.
In the afternoon we cycled to Mũi Né’s main attraction, the large orange sand dunes about ten kilometres south along the coast road. Great photo opportunities—slightly spoiled by children who pounce on every visitor trying to sell bits of plastic for sand-sledding. Farther east the beach becomes less appealing, but there are still countless resorts, and the bay of Mũi Né town itself—with its fishing fleet—is wonderfully photogenic and still feels quite authentic. We took a break at the stylish Moonfish Café & Restaurant around kilometre 16. With its comfortable chairs and divans, it looks the part, and the drinks are pricey. They also try to do ‘creative’ Vietnamese cooking. Sometimes it worked—beef carpaccio with coriander and chilli fish sauce was excellent (40,000 dong)—but the grilled barracuda disappointed. The fish itself (45,000 dong) was fine, but the ‘ginger-lemongrass’ sauce was gloopy and bland. Small portions, though, and a lovely place to sit. As I wasn’t feeling great in the evening, we ate opposite our resort at the Smoke House, a clear tourist trap. Authentic Vietnamese cooking isn’t the goal there, but with fresh grilled seafood you can’t go too wrong. We had a beautifully grilled large red snapper (120,000 dong) and thick clams for 30,000. Suspicious, though, that the already mediocre spring rolls arrived without lettuce, and mint wasn’t available even when we asked. Still—if you cook only for Western tourists, you serve what they expect, not what’s authentic.
Day 19 — 21 March — 130 km
Mũi Né — Phan Thiết — Cà Ná — Phan Rang
I still felt a bit weak, and today was the toughest day of the trip so far—not because of distance or terrain, but because of the stormy wind that blew straight into our faces from the north-east for most of the day. Without it, the ride from Phan Thiết on Highway 1 would have been straightforward: moderate traffic, mostly flat, with only a couple of climbs near Liên Hương and Cà Ná. The landscape, however, was rather bleak—dry and arid, not tropical at all. In calm conditions the full 160 kilometres to Phan Rang would have been no problem. After 130 kilometres of grinding along at about 10 km/h into the gale, I’d had enough and didn’t want to risk ending up riding in the dark. So I flagged down a minibus for the final stretch to Phan Rang, which worked just fine. The old van already had about ten bicycles strapped to the roof and a record-breaking 26 passengers inside. I thought this kind of thing only still existed in Cambodia. It was a memorable experience: even the poorest of the poor—people who still have to travel like this in Vietnam—offered me cigarettes. In the packed minibus I then had to smoke them too, which was less amusing given that you could barely move. Achim had arrived long before me and had already found us accommodation—this time in a proper ‘noble’ establishment, the three-star Ho Phong Hotel just behind the bridge. The value for money was unbeatable: a spacious room with two large beds, a seating area, all the comforts, and a great bathroom with walk-in shower for 14 dollars. Phan Rang is another friendly provincial town where hardly anyone speaks English and very few Westerners stay overnight. And that’s exactly where you have the best unexpected experiences—like tonight’s dinner at Phuong Nam, a big garden restaurant. No English menu, so we ordered by meat type and hope. Soon a live venomous snake was brought to our table, its head cut off in front of us, and the blood mixed with rice liquor. The still-beating heart and another unidentifiable body part (liver, perhaps) were stirred in as well. This potent cocktail is said to boost virility; either way, it didn’t taste bad—sweetish—and so strong that a few sips made you drunk. The snake meat itself was served two ways: delicious minced ‘meatballs’, and cigar-shaped rolls wrapped in seaweed. It was expensive (700,000 dong for the whole snake), but unforgettable. Everything else we’d ordered was excellent and very cheap: grilled squid (40,000 dong), a whole grilled saba fish (50,000), and grouper in a delicate Vietnamese fish soup (40,000). Service was friendly and attentive.
Day 20 — 22 March — 113 km
Phan Rang — Nha Trang
Today on Highway 1 was much more comfortable than yesterday. The wind had eased and no longer blew straight at us; the scenery was also far more appealing—tropical green, shimmering rice fields and coconut palms between the coastal mountains and the central highlands. Proper countryside, and at times Highway 1 felt more like a relaxed country road than the country’s main artery. Traffic wasn’t intimidating, and the wide shoulder makes for easy cycling. A quiet four-lane spur road led the last ten kilometres into Nha Trang. Six years ago I wrote about Vietnam’s most popular beach resort: ‘you can probably write the beach off for the future’, expecting a building boom plus the Vietnamese fondness for kitsch and grandiosity. Luckily, I was wrong. There are many more hotels now, many more tourists, and more than just a couple of ugly high-rise blocks along the promenade—but the beach is still beautiful, even improved by the redesigned waterfront: parks, cafés, and a far nicer promenade. And Nha Trang can absorb the crowds. It’s not just a resort; it’s a real Vietnamese city. People come for sun, comfort, cheap beer, and fresh seafood, and Nha Trang delivers all of that in abundance. With the extra competition, prices have actually softened: rooms can be remarkable bargains, and even the street kitchens on the corner offer grilled lobster at almost absurd prices. For us cyclists, it’s also the ideal rest stop. We stayed at the Thien Tan Hotel in the second row, right in the heart of the tourist quarter between the promenade and D Hung Vuong Street—probably the biggest concentration of budget hotels, cafés, and restaurants in town. Bright modern rooms with a view, all the usual comforts, and a bathtub cost 200,000 dong. Culinarily, Nha Trang is both dream and nightmare: the choice is overwhelming. On every corner someone is advertising fish, lobster, and prawns; the same goes for bars and cafés, many genuinely attractive and competing with drink specials. The capacity here would cope with five times the number of tourists. We headed straight for the Sailing Club, whose Sandals restaurant served us the best meal of our entire trip six years ago. The setting is still superb: comfortable chairs under coconut palms right on the sand, lounge atmosphere with discreet Buddha Bar music, competent friendly service—and the food remains fantastic. On top of the Vietnamese, Japanese, and Italian dishes that were already on offer back then, they now also serve Indian, Malaysian, even Moroccan food. That kind of ‘global’ concept can go badly wrong with mediocre chefs, but everything we tried was perfectly cooked with excellent ingredients: a Mediterranean-Asian mango salad with warm goat’s cheese (80,000), Vietnamese mackerel in a clay pot (65,000), Indian lobster-crab curry (84,000), and Japanese tenzoru soba—prawn tempura with chilled noodles (115,000). High-end for Vietnam, but more than justified by the setting and the cooking.
Day 21 — 23 March — 31 km
We used today’s rest day for practicalities: buying train tickets for Huế–Hà Nội, getting the bikes cleaned and scrubbed (10,000 dong per bicycle), and doing laundry. Of course we also explored a bit of the area around Nha Trang by bike. The beautiful lagoon with Cham ruins in the background is ridiculously photogenic. To the north, a new four-lane corniche runs about ten kilometres along the sea—almost empty of traffic—past more attractive, still uncommercialised beaches and with fine views back over the city and bay. Then, in classic Vietnam fashion, it simply ends at a building site.
Just before the dead end is a lovely excursion spot, Bien Ngoc, where we had breakfast. You sit right by the water with views of Nha Trang’s skyline and the coastal mountains. Our ‘breakfast’ was really more of a snack: tuna sashimi (50,000 dong) and grilled abalone (40,000)—both very good. Back in town it was time for something more substantial, so we went for a barbecue lunch at Lac Canh, a very simple place famous for grilled dishes and one we’d already visited six years ago. Thanks to a deserved Lonely Planet mention there are a few tourists among the customers, but prices are still rock-bottom and the marinated beef and squid you grill yourself at the table are excellent: 28,000 and 32,000 dong. In the afternoon heat we found a quiet spot on the beach in front of Ana Mandara Resort and enjoyed a refreshing swim in the bay before returning to the hotel for a nap—after all, it was a rest day. In the evening, lured by the street aromas, we started at a street grill for four thick grilled lobsters (120,000 dong) and various grilled shellfish. Elsewhere in the world this would be an unaffordable feast; here you sit on tiny plastic chairs by the road and drink cheap beer with it. And to be fair, this stall—on the corner of Tran Phu and Biet Thu—served sauces with the seafood that would satisfy serious gourmet standards. That was enough seafood for one evening, and I fancied pizza. No problem: the Sailing Club turns out wood-fired pizza of near-Neapolitan quality (80,000 dong for a marinara), and we added ayam percik, Malaysian chicken in coconut milk with sambal (85,000), which was also excellent. You could happily eat and drink yourself to death here. Nha Trang is famous for its nightlife, but most bars were half empty—probably the season and the sheer oversupply. I had a couple of cocktails at Crazy Kim Bar: a pleasant enough place with good music. The cocktails weren’t amazing, but they were cheap (25,000 dong) and poured very generously, which is often all you really need.
Day 22 — 24 March — 133 km
Nha Trang — Tuy Hòa
Another full day on Highway 1. The scenery was beautifully varied: rice fields shimmering in different greens on both sides of the road, ending either at the coastal dunes or at the highland mountains. The most striking section was around Dai Lanh, where the highway runs right along a rugged coastline. A white sand beach in a glorious bay invited a swim, and the fishing village at
the northern end—with its fleet—was poor and dirty, but wonderfully photogenic. Most of the route was flat, though for the first time we had two passes: a small one just beyond Nha Trang to reach Highway 1, and the longer, higher Dai Lanh Pass. It offered spectacular coastal views and, in terms of gradient, wasn’t a major challenge. Traffic was again quite relaxed. The surface was mostly very good, the flow of vehicles light, and apart from the pass road there was always a wide shoulder. The final 25 kilometres after the pass turn-off to our destination Tuy Hòa were dead flat, and with the wind at my back I practically flew into town. Tuy Hòa is a small, unremarkable provincial city, but it feels relatively prosperous. There’s an old Cham temple on a hill above town, and the streets and parks are clean and well kept. Accommodation options are plentiful. We stayed in the very blue Da Giang Hotel on the old Highway 1 (there’s now a brand-new bypass). Our room was enormous and bright, with two wide beds, a balcony, and the usual comforts. The bathroom was equally spacious, with a corner tub and separate shower—though it really could have done with a deep clean. Still, 220,000 dong was perfectly reasonable. Tuy Hòa isn’t blessed with endless dining options, but after a longer walk we found three popular open-air restaurants on the street below the Cham temple. We chose the busiest, Cay Man. The menu—what we could decipher—held no surprises: straightforward provincial food, but authentic, with cheap Saigon beer, grilled squid, garlic spinach, and an eel hotpot. All of it, including five bottles of beer, cost less than €7.
Day 23 — 25 March — 113 km
Tuy Hòa — Quy Nhơn
For the first time the day was almost continuously hilly. Again and again we climbed short but fairly steep ridges running across the coast. The highway stayed near the sea, but proper ocean views were mostly limited to the area around Song Cau. Twenty kilometres beyond Song Cau, Highway 1 swings inland. We turned right instead onto the coastal road 1D into Quy Nhơn, finished only two years ago and therefore a joy to ride. After about ten undulating kilometres through dunes, the road becomes a 20-kilometre mountainous run through coastal hills with occasional spectacular views. The scenery is beautiful: small and large bays with white sandy beaches fringed by coconut palms. The road often drops almost down into these bays, then climbs steeply again to continue high above the sea.
With this new, well-built coastal road, the region has real tourist potential, though the few existing resorts seem to cater mainly to Vietnamese visitors. Quy Nhơn—the area’s largest city—is a sleepy, pleasant place, well away from Highway 1 and the usual tourist trail. You could call it a smaller, less commercialised version of Nha Trang. It has a lovely golden sand beach stretching for kilometres along the bay, but so far only two larger hotel complexes, and the promenade is far plainer than Nha Trang’s. Ironically, hotel prices are much higher here—probably because there’s so little competition. I looked at three hotels in town and all offered terrible value. But if you keep looking, you find something. A few kilometres south of the centre on the beach boulevard we found the friendly Au Co Hotel, which was excellent. A huge ‘suite’ with three large beds, seating area, balcony sea view, and lovingly, gloriously kitsch décor cost an unbelievable 180,000 dong. The room was brand new and almost luxurious; only the bathroom was a bit small and basic. Across the road from our hotel was a simple but pleasant beach restaurant, Binh Dan, complete with an English menu. The fresh grilled grouper was superb—some of the best grilled fish I’ve ever had: crisp skin, firm flesh, perfect sauce—though not exactly cheap at 250,000 dong per kilo. Since we didn’t feel like cycling into the centre again, we first had a delicious mango-and-dragon-fruit shake (7,500 dong) from a stall on the promenade, then ate a small meal at the restaurant in the smart Consevco Hotel opposite. Hotel restaurants in Vietnam can feel slightly institutional, but service tends to be attentive and the cooking good. Here the seafood salad with toasted peanuts (40,000) was excellent, and the seafood noodles (35,000) were solid and classic. Even though Consevco is one of the best hotels in town, the restaurant prices were barely higher than in a simple local place.
Day 24 — 26 March — 122 km
Quy Nhơn — Sa Huỳnh
A fairly unspectacular day on Highway 1. The first 50 kilometres were flat; the second half from Phu My was a bit hillier, though after yesterday the hills felt mild. Today the road ran several kilometres inland through classic Vietnamese scenery: rice fields and coconut palms. Interestingly, on this Sunday the traffic—heavy lorries included—was busier than on the previous weekdays, but cycling still felt quite relaxed. And even on an ‘unspectacular’ day, riding through Vietnam is a feast for the eyes: all the greens of the rice fields and vegetation, farmers in conical hats, ox carts by the roadside, rice grains drying on the highway, fruit piled in markets,
motorbikes stacked with pigs, goats, or chickens… Even resting is a pleasure. In roadside cafés you can stretch out in a hammock and, for a few pennies, sip a coconut, pressed sugar-cane juice, or iced coffee. Our destination was Sa Huỳnh, a small place with a long beach in a bay where Highway 1 meets the coast again for the first time in a while. Between road and beach there are a few simple guesthouses with restaurants. We stayed at Ha Lan—very basic, and to reach the room you had to walk through the family’s living space. In return we had a veranda with sea view, plus air-con, minibar and TV, and everything was clean (120,000 dong). We ate dinner there too, and it was simple and good, as expected. Fresh seafood is abundant on this coast. A tasty hotpot, grilled prawns and squid, plus two small whole grilled fish—together with five Saigon beers—came to under €15. Life can be very pleasant.
Day 25 — 27 March — 132 km
Sa Huỳnh — Quảng Ngãi — Tam Kỳ
The last long ‘transfer’ day on Highway 1 for now. The first 20 kilometres were still slightly hilly, but from Duc Pho onward it was almost completely flat through rice fields away from the coast all the way to Tam Kỳ. The town isn’t far from Hội An, yet it sees hardly any tourists—and certainly not many Westerners. We caused quite a stir even just walking through the old riverside market. There’s no shortage of hotels, though. We took a spacious room with two large beds and the usual amenities at the Dong A Hotel on the main road. The bathroom was small and basic, but at 200,000 dong it was perfectly fine—classic Vietnamese provincial hotel. The highlight of the day was dinner at Quan Gio: an utterly simple place with tiny plastic tables and chairs, but hugely popular and wonderfully located on a wooden platform over the river, with views across rice fields. The food was excellent—top-tier provincial standard—and very cheap, and the atmosphere could hardly be bettered. We ate a whole grilled fish, a whole steamed chicken, fried squid, a delicious warm prawn salad, and drank six beers, all for 200,000 dong. Fantastic dipping sauces and attentive service too. Even without an English menu, everything we ordered arrived correctly—which isn’t always a given.
Day 26 — 28 March — 62 km
Tam Kỳ — Hội An
A short, flat morning ride to Hội An. The only challenge was finding the turn-off from Highway 1. They’ve built a new road here but apparently forgot to include an exit for the spur to Hội An, so we had to continue a few kilometres on the new road, then backtrack on the old highway to take the correct turn. It’s also surprising that the road into Hội An—one of the country’s biggest tourist destinations—is still a single-lane country road through rural idyll. In town, however, the tourist infrastructure has changed dramatically in recent years. A whole new district—dozens of hotels, bars, shops and restaurants—has sprung up five minutes north of the old town, thankfully in a low-key style. The oversupply means prices haven’t risen; in fact, room rates have fallen. At the friendly Thanh Xua Hotel, one of several similar new places in that area, we got a modern spacious room with a bathtub and all the usual comforts for just 250,000 dong, including free internet and a pleasant garden café. Hội An’s small historic centre—one of the prettiest in Southeast Asia—has, thankfully, not changed visually. World-heritage status seems to be stronger than greedy speculators. Tourist numbers have of course exploded; every old house now contains a shop, restaurant, or gallery. But rather than killing the charm, it almost adds to it. Hội An is a feel-good tourist town with superb cafés and restaurants, photogenic temples, wonderful architecture… a few more or fewer tourists don’t change the essentials, and the big riverside market feels as authentic as in any less-visited provincial town. Yes, it used to be nice to stroll across the Japanese Bridge alone without being hassled by cyclo drivers (who seem to exist solely for tourists here) or clothes sellers. On the other hand, the culinary scene is far richer and more varied than it was, and honestly that’s a large part of the town’s appeal—especially after so many days in the provinces. Hội An is always a culinary experience. The town is small, yet you could easily spend a month here just working your way through the restaurants. I’m fairly sure it’s rare for your taste buds to be disappointed, wherever you eat. We started with brunch at Mango Rooms, a wonderfully cosy riverside place furnished with colourful bamboo chairs and cushions. The chef doesn’t just do creative local and fusion dishes—he does them very well. Even the amuse-bouche dips were excellent. We ordered vegetables stuffed with marinated beef, crisp baguette spread with prawn mousse served with a delicious coconut-cream curry, and a green mango salad with prawns. Starters ran 25,000–45,000 dong—very fair for the quality and creativity—though drinks were a bit pricey. For lunch we went to Ly 22, an old-established place that was already popular six years ago and still is. The draw remains the ‘a little bit of everything’ four-course menu (60,000 dong) of Hội An specialities: white rose dumplings, fried wontons, prawn spring rolls, and fried marinated pork. Good and cheap—still deservedly one of the town’s favourites.
That you can eat well even in the traveller cafés in the new district was proved by our afternoon snack at Dong Hai, just opposite our hotel. This pleasant café with wicker chairs and cushions is a comfortable alternative to the old town. Both the white roses (15,000 dong) and the bánh xèo—rice-flour pancakes filled with prawns and pork (25,000 dong)—were excellent, and it doesn’t get much cheaper. Drinks are notably cheaper here than in the old town. For dinner we tried the much-praised Café des Amis, a guidebook darling and always full. Mr Kim, the owner, has cooked in Europe and greets every table personally. Given the hype, I wish he’d spent more time in the kitchen, because the set menus didn’t live up to the reputation. There’s no menu; you eat what arrives, with seafood and vegetarian options. French chansons play in the background and the whole thing is inexpensive—on paper a good concept. In reality, the food was merely average Vietnamese standard fare, without creativity or finesse. Perfectly edible, but in a town with so many better and cosier options, the cult popularity is hard to understand. We paid 200,000 dong for two four-course menus (seafood and vegetarian) and four bottles of Larue.
Day 27 — 29 March — 40 km
We had breakfast in the pretty courtyard of Hai Scout Café in the old town. It’s comfortable, the fruit shakes are good and—by Hội An standards—reasonably priced (12,000 dong), and the food is solid. We ate white rose dumplings (25,000), fish fillet steamed in banana leaf (40,000), and a delicious banana-blossom seafood salad (40,000). The countryside around Hội An is perfect for cycling: the quietest province begins the moment you leave town. Narrow lanes run past small villages through green rice fields and usually end at a river or canal. You don’t necessarily get anywhere this way, but it’s gentle riding through rural idyll. The endless, broad Cao Dai Beach is only five kilometres from Hội An. But it has changed dramatically. Six years ago there were a handful of simple, ridiculously cheap seafood places with sun loungers on the sand, and I don’t remember a single large resort. Now there are probably a dozen four-star resorts; the simple restaurants have expanded and tripled their prices, so they’re now more expensive than places in the old town—and the building boom shows no sign of stopping. To be fair, the beach is so long and beautiful that there’s still room for more resorts. I just wonder who is supposed to fill all those rooms and restaurant tables—there’s already overcapacity, and Hội An is not the Costa del Sol. We reached the beach on back roads, including a ‘ferry crossing’ in an old rowing boat, and returned to town on the main road, which is lined for five kilometres with more hotels, resorts, and—importantly—some excellent restaurants. The nicest and cosiest of them all was Son Café, roughly halfway between the old town and the beach. It’s pure Indochina cliché in the best sense: built on stilts over a canal, furnished stylishly with white bamboo chairs, sofas and cushions, overlooking an idyllic landscape of rice fields, coconut palms and water, with traditional music playing softly in the background. And yet it’s almost absurdly cheap: drinks and food are both very affordable. The menu is small—more café-bar than restaurant—with the usual Western standards and Hội An specialities, but the white roses (25,000) and ‘special’ spring rolls (39,000) were tasty, and fruit shakes and beer were just 10,000. Back in town later in the day we had a drink and snack at Banana Leaf Café, one of the prettiest river cafés—lovely to sit in, slightly overpriced drinks, and usually good food. The marinated beef grilled in banana leaf (45,000) could have done with stronger seasoning or a dipping sauce, but I increasingly suspect even places that advertise ‘authentic Vietnamese cuisine’ have started making compromises for Western palates. For happy hour we went to Treat’s, a classic old-town bar where you can get nicely drunk for very little in a cosy atmosphere. The cocktails (around 25,000) and long drinks (25,000 for two) are not only genuinely good but mixed very generously. For dinner we returned to Mango Rooms, having only tried starters last time. The mains passed the test: seared tuna, raw in the middle, with mango salsa (125,000), and prawns wrapped in tender grilled beef were both excellent. Mango Rooms is probably the best restaurant in town right now, and its creative cooking is worth every dong. We’d planned to eat a little something next door at the Cargo Club, one of Hội An’s most popular restaurants. It’s beautifully fitted out with a friendly manager, though its size also attracts tour groups. Unfortunately, they were having trouble with the local authorities over their barbecue set-up and weren’t allowed to grill that evening—ridiculous, but apparently still the sort of thing that happens. So we skipped it and went instead to Hội An Hai San, a small fish restaurant on the river promenade run by a Swedish chef. We only tried his Asian dishes, which were refined and made with excellent ingredients—reflected in slightly higher prices than elsewhere: a classic Thai seafood salad (65,000), grilled scallops (60,000), and a generous seafood brochette with fat prawns, squid, and mussels (80,000).
Day 28 — 30 March — 80 km
Hội An — Đà Nẵng
The coastal road from Hội An to Đà Nẵng is being upgraded to a four-lane highway. Unfortunately only the first five kilometres and the last ten or so are finished; the middle section was miserable—sand, gravel, and potholes in endless rotation. The road runs parallel to the coast, but you barely see the endless China Beach. Instead you get fine views of the Marble Mountains’ pagodas on the way. Đà Nẵng is a city of around a million people—one of the country’s largest—but at first glance you wouldn’t guess it. It feels as if the city is only now waking from a long sleep. A great deal has been built in recent years and the ambition is obvious: Đà Nẵng wants to become a proper metropolis. The city already looks modern and colourful, with new broad boulevards, restored colonial buildings, and a generous river promenade. Construction is still everywhere—among other things a huge new bridge and a seafront promenade at Mỹ Khê Beach. Đà Nẵng isn’t blessed with extraordinary sights or great architecture, but it’s an agreeable, untouristed city—an excellent place to see the ‘real’, modern Vietnam away from the well-worn trail. It’s also very cycle-friendly, with wide streets and moderate traffic. We rode nearly 50 kilometres around town and nearby: out to Mỹ Khê Beach, and along Đà Nẵng Bay almost to the start of the Hải Vân Pass. The beach along the bay isn’t really for sunbathing or swimming—the water is shallow and doesn’t look particularly clean—but it does offer some nice photo opportunities. Food-wise, Đà Nẵng still has some catching up to do. The café culture is less developed than in other cities, and the restaurant scene—bar a few exceptions—feels provincial. Still, this is Vietnam, so we ate well. We had brunch at Vietnam Home, a pleasant open-air place on the river road. They had some interesting dishes, like spring rolls stuffed with snail meat, which were excellent (30,000). The classics were also good and cheap: grilled squid with lemongrass (40,000) and a whole grilled fish (80,000). In the afternoon we tried a seafood hotpot in the floating restaurant opposite the Cham Museum. It’s a converted ship with a rather smart feel and lovely views over the river and museum buildings. The hotpot (110,000) was a bit overpriced for what it was, but the cook was generous with the amount of seafood, and the ingredients were good. Đà Nẵng can do proper Italian coffee too. Bread of Life—a café-bakery supporting hearing-impaired Vietnamese, some of whom work in service—makes a genuinely decent cappuccino for 20,000, and it’s comfortable to sit in. The culinary highlight of the day, and one of the best (and most expensive) meals of the entire trip, was at Apsara—Đà Nẵng’s smartest and probably best restaurant. It’s elegantly designed, with a replica Cham temple in the garden, traditional music performances, and more staff than tables. But it’s not just the setting: the cooking was superb, and for this level of ambience still fairly priced. We treated ourselves to a true feast: three kinds of sashimi (115,000) and grouper maki (30,000), as good as any top Japanese restaurant; a delicious scallop salad served on prawn crackers (58,000); a dozen grilled oysters (54,000); brochettes of marinated beef (38,000); and scallops baked with cheese (65,000). Every dish was a delight, and the whole lot—plus five beers—came to under €25. Our room was also excellent. The Phuong Tam Hotel had opened only two months earlier and was perfectly central on the river boulevard. There was a lift, and rooms with a large bathtub and all the usual comforts for 200,000 dong—after some stubborn bargaining.
Day 29 — 31 March — 112 km
Đà Nẵng — Huế
Leaving Đà Nẵng was pleasantly easy, riding along the bay until after about 15 kilometres the road rejoined Highway 1. What followed was less relaxed. First a motorcyclist crashed into my rear pannier and went down, causing general panic because his child (luckily only lightly) was injured. Through no fault of my own I ended up at a police station where nobody spoke English. Surprisingly, after I described what happened to an English teacher at a nearby school, I was released without hassle or bribes and could continue. Neither I nor the bike had been damaged. After that whole performance, the climb up to the Hải Vân Pass began immediately—the most mountainous section of the entire north–south route, rising to about 500 metres above sea level. The pass is often shrouded in mist and forms a climatic divide between Vietnam’s tropical south and its subtropical north. Today visibility was excellent, and the sunny weather didn’t change much on the northern side either. The coastal scenery here is stunning: powerful mountains dropping to lonely sandy coves. Beyond the pass lies Lăng Cô, a picturesque sandy spit with fishing boats on the beach—pure postcard. The climb itself is a slog, partly because the road surface is rough in places and there are several very steep sections. Between Lăng Cô and Huế there’s another beautiful stretch of Highway 1: two more passes, both much shorter and lower, and otherwise a flat, pleasant run. Huế, the old imperial capital, is one of the country’s main tourist magnets. Last time, though, it left me oddly cold. The once-grand citadel was badly destroyed in the war and only a handful of buildings remain. Apart from that, Huế is a nice enough town, but not so special that it deserves the crowds it draws. The number of annoying sellers and cyclo drivers is certainly high. We stayed at the friendly Hai Dang Hotel, very central on the main road to the river. Our room was simple but spotless, with two large beds and the usual basics. There was no lift, but we did have a proper shower cubicle with excellent water pressure—still a rarity in Vietnam. At 160,000 dong it was outstanding value, especially as we could keep the room until tomorrow afternoon. Huế is considered Vietnam’s culinary capital, but our first meal—an afternoon stop at the recommended Tropical Garden—was only middling. It’s a lovely place to sit, as the name suggests, in a tropical garden, but the cooking was merely average and didn’t justify the higher prices. The marinated tuna grilled in banana leaf (60,000) was good, as was the lime marinade on the otherwise rather tough beef pieces (50,000). By contrast, Huế’s famous ‘pancake’ with peanut sauce (16,000) was dry and bland. In the evening we played it safe and returned to a place we already trusted. We’d eaten very well at Paradise Garden six years ago, and it was excellent again. There are more Western diners now than locals, but it’s still cheap, and you sit nicely in a garden on the riverside promenade, which has since been pedestrianised. Service is lacklustre, but the beer is cheap, the fish-filled spring rolls (40,000) are among the best in Vietnam, and portions are generous. Also very good were Huế-style beef salad (40,000) and ram Huế (30,000), a local speciality resembling small meat-filled samosas served with peanut sauce.
Day 30 — 1 April — 70 km
Huế — Hà Nội
We began by cycling through the quiet streets of the outer citadel, a part of town that feels almost village-like. Again and again we caught lovely views of the inner citadel’s towers and walls—though entry costs money. On the western moat we found a beautifully set-up local café, Mot Thong Saigon, and had iced coffee with condensed milk. We then left Huế along a narrow, idyllic country road, partly following the Perfume River’s north bank and passing the photogenic Thien Mu Pagoda. After about 15 kilometres we crossed the river at the village of Tuan and took winding back roads past several royal tombs back towards Huế. We skipped a second visit to the tombs, largely because foreigner entry fees are still exorbitant (5 dollars). In any case, cycling around Huế is genuinely pleasant—often on small, bumpy lanes through pretty countryside. Navigation was tricky with poor maps, but asking locals made it easy enough to find our way back. For lunch we had our best meal in Huế at Tan Long, a simple local place that was nevertheless very nicely arranged. It’s a little outside the centre, west of the station on the south bank road, and didn’t even have an English menu—unusual for a tourist town like Huế. Maybe that’s why it was both cheap and delicious: crisp nems (30,000) served properly with lettuce, mint and coriander; an excellent beef salad (30,000); finely marinated grilled squid (30,000); and two small grilled catfish (40,000). A large bottle of Huda cost only 6,000—an authentic, highly recommended spot. After lunch we made a small excursion to a village about seven kilometres south of the centre with an old covered bridge—architecturally very similar to Hội An’s famous Japanese Bridge. Tourists don’t seem to come here, but it’s a worthwhile ride along narrow country lanes, and the bridge is a lovely photo subject. In pouring rain we cycled to the station in the afternoon and learned that our express train to Hà Nội had no luggage car for bicycles, so the bikes would have to go on tomorrow’s train instead. Assuming they arrive, it’s not the end of the world. I’m writing these lines in our sleeping compartment, which is not exactly luxurious: four berths squeezed into a narrow space, slightly dubious bedding, and dinner on the train—although included in the fare—utterly inedible. This is first-class sleeper, mind you. It’s no comparison with the comfort of Thai trains; you even have to make the beds yourself. For a bit over €20 you’d expect rather more.
Days 31–33 — 2–4 April — 72 km
After roughly twelve hours on the train, and a delay of just over an hour, we arrived in Hà Nội early in the morning. As we didn’t yet have the bikes and many hotels weren’t open at that hour, our options were limited, so we took a taxi straight to the Viet Anh in the Old Quarter. This fairly new, well-located hotel is constantly full as an ‘Author’s Choice’ in the new Lonely Planet, and has already raised its prices accordingly. On the plus side: free internet, a lift, and a decent breakfast buffet—though in Hà Nội breakfast buffets are almost unnecessary. The hotel even has doormen, unusual at this price level. The room itself was nothing special: modern and reasonably comfortable, with parquet flooring, satellite TV and air-con, but rather small for Hà Nội, and the bathroom—despite a tub—was basic and tight. So perhaps a bit expensive at 20 dollars, but they clearly don’t need to charge less. We had breakfast at Little Hà Nội. Six years ago it had the best shrimp cakes in town; they were still excellent, but much more expensive than back then (59,000 dong). In general, the price level in Old Quarter tourist cafés is surprisingly high—higher than anywhere else in Vietnam. Tourism has increased dramatically over the last few years. The Old Quarter still offers authentic street scenes and wonderfully photogenic moments, but the harassment from cyclo drivers, xe ôm riders, and street sellers has become barely tolerable. The cyclos in particular seem to exist almost entirely for foreign tourists now—carrying locals presumably no longer pays. That doesn’t mean the whole district is a boring, inauthentic tourist trap. Not at all. Life still goes on here as it always has: in the hectic markets, the street kitchens, the bia hơi joints, and the little shops, with thousands of motorbikes squeezing through narrow streets and alleyways. Tourists are still a side note in most locals’ daily lives. And beyond the chaotic Old Quarter there is another Hà Nội: elegant and dignified, with stately colonial villas, quiet temples, many lakes, and broad avenues. It’s precisely these two completely different faces that make Hà Nội so attractive. After spending our first day on foot mainly in the Old Quarter and around Hoàn Kiếm Lake, we used our bicycles to the full on the second day—by then they had arrived from Huế without damage. We rode 40 kilometres criss-crossing the city and looping around West Lake. The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum was closed, and we skipped the Temple of Literature this time because too many tour groups have turned what used to be a place of calm into a busy attraction. Instead of ticking off classic sights, we preferred a culinary crawl through street kitchens, quán eateries, cafés, and ‘posh’ restaurants, and made plenty of discoveries. Generally speaking, when it comes to traditional Vietnamese food you eat just as well at the street kitchens as you do in the elegant restaurants that now exist in abundance in Hà Nội. The difference is ambience and, of course, price. At street stalls you can get traditional treats like bánh cuốn, bánh gối, nem, or Hà Nội’s fish speciality chả cá for almost nothing, and even seafood without having to rob a bank. The very same dishes can also be had in smart, refined settings—often in restored villas—arranged prettily, presented by smiling staff. The days when you could get such a gourmet meal in luxurious surroundings for €10 for two are gone, but it’s still far cheaper than at home, and sometimes it’s simply nice to be pampered in comfort. We sat in the courtyard of Green Tangerine, in front of a picturesque restored Old Quarter villa. The cooking is mostly Mediterranean with Vietnamese touches, and the two-course lunch menu at 95,000 dong is genuinely good value: you choose from five mains and five desserts. We went for excellent beef carpaccio with an Asian-garnished warm potato salad, and a passionfruit-mango cheesecake. À-la-carte dishes range from 4 to 12 dollars, but even the generously topped baguette with scallops, lavender and tomatoes for $5.90 was hard to complain about. Nice presentation and good service; the only criticism was the absurd drink pricing ($2.50 for a bottle of Lavie water). The other ‘posh’ restaurant we tried was less convincing. In La Lua – Wild Rice there was nothing wrong with the quality—the spring rolls filled with prawns and cashews (60,000) were crisp, and both the mussel salad (70,000) and the duck-and-bamboo-shoot salad (80,000) tasted as authentically Vietnamese as at a street stall. But in a place where a bottle of water costs nearly 3 dollars, you’d hope for more creativity; it simply lacked any sense of surprise. Given the ambience the food prices were reasonable, but there are surely better restaurants in this bracket. The best food we had in Hà Nội, however, was at the affordable and authentic Quán Ăn Ngon. This huge open-air place near the station is an offshoot of the restaurant of the same name where we’d already eaten in Saigon, and it’s rightly popular with Hà Nội’s middle class and with a few in-the-know Westerners. In a beer-garden atmosphere, local specialities—mainly soups, seafood and starters—are cooked in front of you and brought straight to the table. Quality is excellent, and for a feast of five different starters (bánh and nem), fresh oysters, beef salad and squid skewers we paid, beer included, just over €10. The best cappuccino in town (25,000 dong) was at the charming Café au Lac. It’s not actually by the lake, but you sit quietly in a lovely courtyard in front of an old villa. Although it’s in one of the city’s best areas near the Opera, prices are surprisingly moderate—cheaper than some backpacker cafés in the Old Quarter. You can eat well here too: we had chả cá (62,000) and ginger-lemongrass pork (49,000). Also recommended is the newly opened little Café May 22. There’s no outdoor seating, but the food is good and cheap. They offer European and Vietnamese dishes; we only tried the Vietnamese. The green mango salad with seafood (35,000) and the seafood spring rolls (30,000) were excellent, and drink prices are sensible. This morning we had breakfast at Café 69 on Mã Mây. Again, solid and fairly cheap: a fine assortment of spring rolls (four different types for 45,000), and a successful attempt at ‘fusion’ with a salad of mango slices, yoghurt dressing and chicken (35,000). Then it was off to the airport: over the Red River on a kilometre-long bridge and then along the cycle lane beside a four-lane highway—about 30 kilometres in total. Hà Nội’s airport is small, modern and comfortable, and our AirAsia flight to Bangkok was on time. We only reached Banglamphu in the evening and took a room at Mango Lagoon Place. It was a pleasant reminder that you can eat extremely well in Thailand too. Dinner at Hemlock’s was superb: classic Thai cooking, hard to beat in Bangkok, and especially at these prices. The Tavoy spicy salad with chicken and sesame (80 baht) was excellent, as was the gang kua pineapple-prawn curry (80 baht), plus fish patties (80 baht) and a ferociously hot jungle curry (75 baht).
Days 34–35 — 5–6 April
We spent our last two days in Bangkok shopping and eating, as you do in Bangkok. The sushi at Taketei was still excellent, as were the curries and tandoori dishes at Royal India. We ate fantastic dim sum (35 baht per portion) at Shangri La on Yaowarat, and superb seafood at Somboon Seafood, one of Bangkok’s biggest and most popular restaurants. The interior, spread over four floors, is canteen-ugly, but the service and food are excellent—though not exactly cheap. Crab curry (250 baht), raw marinated crab meat (150 baht), and scallops with green asparagus (150 baht). To round off a successful trip, we treated ourselves to a final gourmet meal at Blue Elephant.
