## Prologue

### Day 1–2 | 13.–14.7.  
**Frankfurt – Dhaka – Bangkok**

When you choose to fly with Biman and save nearly €200, you have to accept that your arrival at your destination will be significantly delayed. We were no exception. When we rocked up at Frankfurt Airport, the departures board already showed our 3:20 PM flight was delayed until 11:45 PM. Luckily, we were able to check in our luggage straight away, and the bikes were accepted with no fuss and no extra charge. Relieved of our baggage, we did the only sensible thing and hopped on the S-Bahn into Frankfurt, which suited me fine as I’d never seen the city before. It was a hot, muggy summer’s day, and most cities look attractive when the weather's good—even Frankfurt. The city’s famous skyline is quite nice to look at from the Main bridges, although in other countries, people would just smile wearily at the handful of skyscrapers. The small old town centre around the Römer is rather pretty, but the city’s real highlight is the Sachsenhausen district south of the river. It’s a lovely area packed with street cafés, pubs, and beer gardens tucked away in cobbled alleys. As a tourist, I couldn’t resist drinking two glasses of Ebbelwoi (apple wine) and eating a portion of Frankfurter sausages there.

Back at the airport, we used our Biman vouchers, and it genuinely seemed like we might finally be getting away, as boarding started just before midnight. However, for some inexplicable reason, another two hours passed before the plane eventually took off, followed by an unscheduled stopover in Rome to pick up more passengers. At least we were allowed to leave the plane there. In the end, we were finally on our way to Dhaka around 5 AM. In terms of in-flight comfort and service, though, you can’t really grumble about Biman. We reached Dhaka about nine hours later, around 6 PM local time, which meant we had to—or got to—spend the night in the capital of Bangladesh. The hotel room Biman provided was decent, just a bit out in the sticks, so we scrapped the plan to go into the centre and instead explored the local area a bit on foot, grabbing two samosas from a street vendor. Despite the poverty and relentless overpopulation, the hassle factor here is much lower than in India. Apart from one or two beggars, we could walk around completely unmolested without attracting much attention. The chance to wander the streets of this suburb alone made the delay worthwhile.

### Day 3 | 15.7  
**Dhaka – Bangkok**

The night wasn’t very long, as for some mysterious reason, we were summoned for breakfast before six. The onward flight to Bangkok was scheduled for 10:25 AM. After breakfast, we were informed that the flight had been moved to 2:30 PM. All the better: since we were already in Dhaka, we had plenty of time to have a look around—though strangely, all the other travellers preferred to stay put in the hotel. We hired a taxi for three hours (750 TK) and had him drive us around the area with a few stops along the way. Apart from the architecturally, well, adventurous Parliament House, Dhaka doesn’t really have any tourist sights; it’s a vast sprawl of featureless, often half-finished, buildings. There doesn't seem to be a proper old town like in Lahore or Delhi. However, the city is by no means uninteresting. The sheer thousands of partly ornate rickshaws, the main mode of transport here, are quite a sight, as are the old double-decker buses. Besides, tropical cities, even if they're not pretty, always have a special atmosphere.

We eventually got away around 3 PM and finally arrived in Bangkok after a two-hour flight, 54 hours behind schedule. Taking the bikes on the airport bus (50B) was no problem, and we reached Sukhumvit around half-past seven in the evening, only to find that hotel after hotel was completely booked up. Fortunately, we finally found a room at the Promenade on Soi 8. It was a standard, mid-range hotel with no particular charm, but the rooms were very decent, freshly renovated, spacious, and came with the usual comforts for that price range, like a mini-bar and a bath. 1200 Baht was a fair price for this area.

For dinner, we went to Cabbages & Condoms on Soi 12, one of Bangkok’s most famous restaurants, probably because it’s a non-profit venture supporting HIV-positive people. But the food was also genuinely excellent—classic Thai cuisine, impeccably prepared—and the décor is rather artful; who knew condoms could be used for so many things! The open-air area with its fountain and string lights offered a touch of the tropics right in the concrete jungle of Sukhumvit. We ordered three starters: Thai Dim Sum, Fried Morning Glory, and the "Special Thai Appetizer," and for the main course, steamed seafood in coconut cream with lemongrass (200B). Everything was delicious! Cabbages & Condoms isn't exactly cheap, but the whole meal cost less than €15, including drinks.


## Thailand

<div class="country thailand">

### Day 4 | 16.7 | 90 km  
**Bangkok – Samut Prakan – Chonburi**

Normally, it's not a brilliant idea to start a tour immediately after such a flying ordeal, complete with jet lag and sleep deprivation. But I thought it sensible to leave Bangkok on a Sunday, as the traffic would be more bearable than on a weekday. That was certainly the case, and we got out of the seemingly endless city without any issues, just following Sukhumvit Road. The traffic was heavy and chaotic even today, but overall, as cyclists, we always had enough space on the multi-lane road.

After nearly 40 kilometres, just past Samut Prakan, the six-lane road narrowed to two lanes and ran parallel to a canal. The hard shoulder here was wide and made for easy riding. Along the canal, there were shacks with benches set up, perfect for resting. And we desperately needed it, because, just as I'd suspected, the jet lag was taking its toll. I can’t remember ever having such heavy legs on a 90 km flat stage.

By the time we reached Chonburi, I was so knackered I didn't even have the energy to shower, let alone go out to eat. Luckily, we had a delicious Fried Rice from a street vendor by the canal at lunchtime, and Chonburi seemed like a rather characterless provincial town at first glance, so I don't think we missed much. We stayed at the Hotel Likith, a typical Thai town hotel with no charm but decent, if slightly neglected, rooms with air-con and a hot water shower for 550B.

### Day 5 | 17.7 | 58 km  
**Chonburi – Pattaya**

Today’s ride on the busy, four-to-six-lane Highway 3 down to Pattaya was no pleasure. There was literally nothing to see along the way, no nice rest stops, let alone cafés, and one noisy lorry after another roared past.

The only reason to cycle to Pattaya and even stay the night was that we hadn't had time to do various errands in Bangkok—and you have to give this run-down, vulgar sin-pit one thing: the infrastructure is superb; there's almost nothing you can't get. On my first visit here more than six years ago, I lasted only two hours of the commotion, the yobs, and the sex tourists before fleeing to Bangkok. I can't understand who would choose to spend their holiday here. The beach is narrow and cluttered with deck chairs, and a never-ending torrent of traffic rolls past on the beach road; there’s zero atmosphere or relaxed holiday feel. You can drink and eat well in Thailand in far nicer places, and usually more cheaply, too.

At least we had a very nice room at the AA Pattaya Residence on Soi 13, 100 metres from the beach. The spacious rooms were extremely comfortable with a marble bathroom, mini-bar, and a seating area, and they seemed almost brand new. A real bargain at 700B.

We also ate very well in the evening—the selection in Pattaya is enormous, of course. The Lobster Pot is a seafood restaurant with a terrace overlooking the sea, a beautiful spot to eat fish. We ordered sautéed mussels (195B), salad with shrimp sashimi (195B), grilled squid (195B), and a whole grilled Red Snapper (295B). The food was delicious, naturally, but perhaps a touch too expensive by Thai standards.

### Day 6 | 18.7 | 145 km  
**Pattaya – Phanom Sarakham**

There’s not much to write about today; the jet lag and tiredness have passed, so the 145 km were easily managed, even on a fairly hilly route. First, we cycled back towards Bangkok for about ten kilometres, then turned right onto the 36, and after another 15 km, onto the 331, which led north through the interior—initially single-lane, later a four-lane highway with not too much traffic.

For about 80 kilometres up to Ploeng Yao, the route was a continuous up and down, though without any steep or long climbs, and there wasn’t a single large town along the way. Stocking up was still easy, as this area is very developed with many petrol stations and rest areas, but the scenery was unspectacular.

The original plan was to stop at Ploeng Yao. Since there was no hotel there, we had to carry on to the next larger town, Phanom Sarakham. These last 30 kilometres led flat through rice fields and were quickly done, although the traffic on the four-lane Highway 304 was incredibly heavy.

We stayed at the only hotel in the village, the Phanom City, a slightly run-down provincial hotel with the usual functional rooms for 450B. For dinner, we ate at one of the street food stalls lining the highway. They served Laab with sticky rice and a very generous, delicious meat hotpot for €3.

### Day 7 | 19.7 | 150 km  
**Phanom Sarakham – Aranya Prathet**

After 20 kilometres on the four-lane 304, we turned right towards the east onto the sparsely travelled 359, which followed the gently rolling topography through remote countryside. With its new surface, low traffic, and wide hard shoulder, it was a pleasure to cycle on.

Although there weren't any proper villages for more than 80 kilometres, finding provisions was never a problem. The last 50 kilometres to Aranya Prathet on Highway 33 were flat, four-lane, and lightly trafficked again, allowing for rapid progress.

The scenery along the entire route so far, however, was utterly unremarkable—either urban sprawl or monotony. Our destination, Aranya Prathet, is merely a transit point for 99 per cent of all tourists on their way to or from Cambodia, and few of them ever get stranded here. Nevertheless, there are a few hotels, and the place is quite pleasant, if not pretty.

Our room at the Market Motel behind the market was simple but spacious and clean, with air-con, a fridge, and a hot water shower. There was even a pool. Very decent for 400B. The motel also has a very popular restaurant that serves only one dish: table-top Hotpot Barbecue (literally). Chicken, pork, and liver—very tasty and extremely cheap (150B for two people with mineral water).

### Day 8 | 20.7 | 132 km  
**Aranya Prathet – Nang Rong**

The first 60 kilometres on the 348 were flat, running parallel to the Cambodian border through an area that is relatively underdeveloped and economically depressed for Thailand. If the road hadn't been in such excellent condition, you could almost have imagined yourself in the neighbouring country—it was a sparsely populated area with rather appealing scenery.

The second half of the route began with a mile-long, partly very steep climb onto the Isaan plateau, before the last 60 kilometres became gently rolling, on a pleasant, lightly trafficked road into Nang Rong.

This small town would be completely insignificant were it not for the several beautiful Khmer temple complexes nearby that put it on the tourist map. Consequently, it has a very nice guesthouse, the Honey Inn, where I’d stayed four years ago when I visited Phanom Rung. Not much has changed here; the good small rooms with air-con and a hot water shower cost 350B, or only 150B without air-con. The beds aren't the comfiest, but the rooms are very well kept.

In the evening, we and the four other guests were served a delicious and generous meal for 100 Baht, which included a whole fried fish and a chicken and coconut curry.

### Day 9 | 21.7 | 102 km  
**Nang Rong – Prasat – Surin**

Today’s relatively short stage into the provincial capital of Surin was flat all the way and easily managed by early afternoon. We cycled nearly 70 kilometres east on the fairly busy, two-lane 24, and then from Prasat, we headed north on the four-lane, comfortable 214.

Surin is famous for its annual Elephant Festival, but even without that, this unspectacular, unhurried town is a nice place to stop. We took a room at the Sangthong Hotel for 400B. The rooms in this very large, basic town hotel are a little dated, with mid-century air conditioning and an even older telephone, but they made up for it with their spaciousness and the hotel's central location.

Late in the afternoon, we treated ourselves to a half-hour ride (50B) on a rickshaw through the streets of this pleasant little town, then headed to the night market for dinner, where we sampled various delicious snacks: Isaan sausages, mussel salad, meat skewers, red chicken curry... and even delicious Cambodian Amok was on offer. A gourmet’s delight, and all for next to nothing.

### Day 10 | 22.7 | 31 km  
**Surin – Roi Et**

When I woke up this morning, I had excruciating pain in both knees; I could barely walk. I thought it would ease off once I was on the bike, but at the first stop after 28 kilometres, I just couldn't continue. My left knee had swollen to twice its normal size, and I couldn't even stand without support.

So, I had no choice but to hop on the bus for the rest of the way, which worked out fine. The villagers were all very helpful, and the police officer personally flagged down the bus for me.

Once in Roi Et, I somehow dragged myself from the bus station to the hotel and enjoyed the comfort of the room at the Mai Thai, a former first-class hotel that’s now a little tired and in need of renovation. Nevertheless, the rooms were clean and very spacious, with a bath and a fridge—a real bargain for 460B.

I spent most of the day in the room, as the pain had hardly subsided. However, since I needed to get to a chemist, I took the opportunity to look around Roi Et a bit. It’s a pleasant, fairly quiet town with a small lake right in the centre; nothing spectacular, but very few provincial towns in Thailand are truly beautiful.

I honestly couldn't face going out in the evening, but Achim picked up various tasty treats from the night market, which we then ate in the room.

### Day 11 | 23.7  
**Roi Et – Khon Kaen**

Cycling was out of the question again today. Although I felt a bit better, the pain was still too much. So, I took the bus to Khon Kaen, one of Isaan’s most important cities. It was Sunday, and the city was fairly quiet.

I checked into the Rossukund Hotel, a rather nice, simple mid-range hotel with a stylish lobby and very tidy, well-appointed rooms with a bath and a balcony for 600B.

By midday, I felt well enough to cycle a little again and rode to the lovely Kaen Nakhon Lake south of the centre for lunch. Not only is this the nicest part of the city, but it also has a wonderfully situated waterside restaurant, the Bualuang, built on stilts over the lake. It was a lovely place to sit, but the food was a mixed bag. The eggplant and seafood salad (80B) was excellent, while the Lemon Chicken (80B) was quite bland.

Otherwise, Khon Kaen is a well-kept, modern city of typical Thai character, with shopping malls and business hotels, but also wooden houses and street food stalls.

When Achim arrived, we went for a quick dinner at Sorrento. The restaurant's name is misleading, as it doesn't serve Italian cuisine, but the menu is huge, and they have live music and a sushi bar. We ordered Thai food, though: duck in garlic sauce (199B for a whole duck), grilled squid (99B with a fine sauce), and Yam Nüa, authentically spicy enough to bring tears to your eyes.

### Day 12 | 24.7 | 121 km  
**Khon Kaen – Udon Thani**

Today, I could finally get back on the bike pain-free, and the ride, on the surprisingly lightly trafficked four-lane Highway 2 (with a wide hard shoulder), was ideal for getting back into the swing of things. The first 100 kilometres were relatively hilly for Isaan but pleasant to ride; the final stretch into Udon Thani was completely flat.

Udon is the biggest city in the region, but also one of the cosiest. The traffic here isn't as intense as in other large Thai cities, and while Udon isn't an architectural masterpiece either, I’ve liked the atmosphere here the best so far. This is mainly due to Nong Prajak, a fairly large lake northwest of the centre, whose newly built lakeside paths are eagerly used by locals for cycling, jogging, and strolling.

The lake also offers some great photo opportunities, especially at sunset, and on the eastern shore, there is a wonderful restaurant, the Rabiang Patchani, where we ate dinner. The prices here were a bit higher than in an ordinary provincial eatery, but you had a great view over the lake and the sunset, and the menu offered a massive selection of local, Chinese, and seafood specialties. The quality of the cooking was also faultless.

We ordered a hors d'oeuvre platter (250B, including spring rolls, prawns on a skewer, and pork in banana leaves), Duck Laab (90B), and Yam Nua (90B). Authentically spicy and delicious.

Along the eastern shore road of the lake, there are numerous small food stalls and eateries, plus loads of open-air massage parlours. The atmosphere here in the evening is truly lovely, and we treated ourselves to a relaxing, hour-long foot massage with a lake view for 100 Baht.

Our hotel was one block from Nong Prajak. The Charoensri Palace was anything but a palace, more of a tired, old provincial town hotel, but our room was cheap (380B) and adequate. It was windowless, admittedly, but clean and spacious with air-con, a bath, and satellite TV—perfectly fine for the night—and the staff even spoke decent English, a rarity in this area.

### Day 13 | 25.7 | 112 km  
**Udon Thani – Tha Bo – Nong Khai**

It’s only 55 kilometres from Udon to Nong Khai on Highway 2, but we took the detour via the quiet rural roads 2021 and 2020 to Tha Bo on the Mekong. This route through rice fields in a rural idyll was quite hilly, but apart from a few short stretches of bad surface, it was good to cycle on.

The most scenic part of the tour so far led for nearly 30 kilometres along the Mekong into Nong Khai. Here, traditional Thai wooden houses still exist; there were often views over the mighty river, and the narrow road was a joy to cycle, thanks to the new surface and low traffic.

Nong Khai is one of Isaan’s most touristy places due to its location at the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, though things are quiet right now. But even without this strategic location, Nong Khai would be worth a visit. The riverside districts are very attractive, with a very relaxed feel. You can even admire a bit of French colonial architecture, and the beautiful traditional wooden houses haven't all been razed to the ground yet.

The town’s greatest asset, however, is its magnificent location right on the Mekong, along whose bank runs a narrow road—interrupted only by the large market—where there are several restaurants and bars with great views. I could imagine that some of the Laotian and Cambodian provincial towns on the Mekong will look similar to Nong Khai in ten or twenty years. Compared to other Thai cities, Nong Khai has retained a certain authenticity even after its economic boom, and doesn't just consist of concrete boxes.

Accommodation is plentiful here, of course, and we treated ourselves to something a bit more upmarket today. The Pantawee isn't exactly the most atmospheric hotel in town, but our room was superb: comfortable with two large, cosy beds, a veranda, a DVD player, and its own computer with free broadband internet. Now that's what I call luxury, and at a very reasonable price for 900B. The bathroom was quite basic—an Asian wet room—but the shower was excellent.

We had planned to eat at one of the riverside restaurants, but the night market drew us back. At Dee Dee, we ate an extremely delicious salad with seafood and fresh mushrooms (70B) and wonderful green asparagus with prawns and squid (110B), plus some decent Dim Sum (20B for three pieces).

We had already been to the most stylish café in town (well, the only stylish one) in the afternoon. The nicely decorated CoCoNa served decent cappuccino (35B) and surprisingly good bistro food like salmon sashimi (120B) and Som Tam with squid (70B).

## Laos

<div class="country laos">

### Day 14 | 26.7 | 38 km  
**Nong Khai – Vientiane**

It was raining this morning, so we set off a little later. Still, it was early enough that after crossing the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, we had to pay an extra $1 charge for our visa because we arrived at the border before 8 AM. Surprisingly, however, we were given 30 days instead of the usual 15, so we can now save on a visa extension.

It was time to say goodbye to Thailand and its excellent infrastructure. The road into Vientiane was a pothole-ridden track for the first ten kilometres, meaning slow progress, but nearer the city, the highway had already been newly paved and was great to cycle on.

Vientiane has developed rapidly since my last visit about four years ago. The traffic seems to have increased fivefold, with many new, sometimes very swanky cars making the roads of the once-sleepy capital hazardous. There are some brand-new hotels and shopping complexes, and there's even something that looks like a high-rise on the riverbank.

Nevertheless, Vientiane is still a cosy little city by global standards, with a relaxed atmosphere, a wonderful location on the Mekong, and an attractive city centre that’s easy to explore on foot.

We took a room at the Sengprachanh Hotel right on Lane Xang, Vientiane's answer to the Champs-Élysées, located near the Triumphal Arch. This hotel had only opened yesterday, so it offered a special rate of 600 Baht for a brand-new, thoroughly comfortable room—a bargain we snapped up immediately, especially as Vientiane isn't known for great value accommodation.

Before we started exploring the city, we sorted out a few practical matters, including getting a visa for Cambodia. It was a bit pricey ($40), but the border crossing down on the Mekong is apparently still semi-official, and I think it’s best to show up with a valid visa.

We had lunch at Nang Kham Bang, still a very popular, simple place where I had the best local food in Laos on my last trip. The quality is still excellent; we ordered Beef Laab, Fish Laab, and grilled beef tongue (20,000k each), all of which tasted superb. Only the raw beef salad, my favourite dish on the first visit, was inedible this time; apparently, they now use raw offal for the salad, which is definitely not for me.

The afternoon was supposed to be a relaxed stroll around town, but Achim had lost all his credit cards at the ATM, which we only noticed later at the hotel. So, it was back to the bank, where we learned the cards had indeed been found, but the person who found them had already gone home.

Since Laotians are generally very helpful, though, a bank employee, who was an acquaintance of the card finder, took me on his motorbike to a suburban eatery. I was only handed the cards back after I'd downed two complimentary bottles of Lao beer with them and—of course, with a grateful smile—choked down some offal that was on the table. It was a genuinely interesting cultural experience, and the people were very kind.

Later, we had an aperitif at the Daofa Bistro by Nam Phou; this is probably the most comfortable street café in the city, and they had a 0.5-litre carafe of simple French country wine for 50,000k and delicious salmon garlic bread for 35,000k.

In the evening, we ate Laotian again at Soukvimarn, a very nice, simple place in a wooden villa near the Black Stupa. According to our guide, this was supposed to be the best local eatery in the city, but it did not particularly suit my palate. The steamed fish with vegetables (45,000k) was quite tasty, but both the beef liver sausage and another unidentifiable dish we ordered were very much not to my liking.

I must say, though, that Laotian cuisine did not particularly impress me on my first visit to the country either. Very decent cappuccino (15,000k) and good fruit shakes were available at La Fontaine Café in a side street by Nam Phou.

### Day 15 | 27.7 | 103 km  
**Vientiane – Hin Heup**

Today, we followed Highway 13 north. Cycling out of Vientiane was straightforward, and the further we got from the city, the thinner the traffic became.

The first 40 kilometres weren't particularly interesting, as the road passed through numerous villages that felt more like capital suburbs and weren't very traditional.

I took a small detour to Nam Souan, a beautifully situated lake four kilometres west of the highway on a bumpy track. There was supposed to be a waterfall there, but I didn't find it.

After about 70 kilometres came the first larger town, Phonehong. Until then, the road had been mostly flat, with only occasional, sometimes quite steep, inclines to conquer.

The most interesting part of the route began after Phonehong. It was scenically stunning, with rice fields and gorgeous chains of hills from which waterfalls tumbled between coconut palms and boulders. A tropical dreamscape on a with very little traffic road.

This section was naturally harder to cycle—very undulating, and there was even a small pass to cross. But the beautiful scenery was compensation enough.

We stayed at the Souksamvang Guesthouse just before Hin Heup. This is the only guesthouse for miles around and not exactly luxurious. The rooms, like the bathroom, are extremely basic, but at least there's a fan and a Western toilet, even if it doesn't flush.

But you don't really need more than a bed and a shower, and that's what we got—and it wasn't grubby either (40,000k).

For dinner, we went to the simple eatery on the highway about 100 metres from our guesthouse. Surprisingly, they had a detailed English menu, but the only things available were fish soup, pork and vegetables, and fish Laab. It was perfectly decent and very cheap (28,000k).

The unspectacular meal actually turned into a cultural experience. Shortly after we arrived at the restaurant, a host of locals from Hin Heup gradually rolled in and threw a small party. Naturally, we were invited and immediately plied with Lao beer until we couldn't drink any more, purely out of hospitality, without any ulterior motive.

This is the second evening I've been invited for beer and food, and it’s only our second day in Laos. This is the kind of thing you only experience when, by chance (like yesterday) or because you're travelling by bike, you arrive in utterly untouristed places where you’re treated as an honoured guest, not a walking wallet.

### Day 16 | 28.7 | 83 km  
**Hin Heup – Vang Vieng**

The first almost 50 kilometres today were by far the hilliest of the tour so far. Like a small mountain road in Europe, narrow, lightly trafficked, and with plenty of potholes, the highway wound its way up and down through the beautiful landscape. There were only a few small villages with poor-looking wooden shacks along the way.

As you slowly approach Vang Vieng by bike, it’s hard to imagine you’re about to reach one of Asia’s most popular traveller hangouts. Because that's what Vang Vieng undoubtedly is—four years ago, I described the place as the Khaosan Road in the Laotian rice fields—even if things are quiet here right now due to the rainy season.

However, Vang Vieng's popularity is mainly due to its stunning location on a river amidst a postcard backdrop of rice fields and karst formations. The town itself isn't particularly attractive; right now, it looks more like a massive building site, and a lot of it feels temporary. Hopefully, they’ll manage to make the place appealing to tourists without robbing it of its laid-back atmosphere.

We checked into a bungalow at the Thavonsouk around midday, a very attractive resort in a prime location, set in a garden right by the river. Even though we took the cheapest room ($15), it was very decent and well worth the price. Spacious, with air-con, a modern bathroom, and a veranda that offered fantastic views despite being set back from the river.

Vang Vieng in the rainy season is a completely different place. Where in winter and spring, charming temporary cafés with bamboo mats line the bank, the Nam Song now flows wide and mighty through the valley, making a river crossing impossible.

Fortunately, a permanent bridge currently under construction, while not quite finished, is at least usable, so we were able to cycle out to Tham Poukham in the afternoon without having to take a boat.

I had visited this cave four years ago and was particularly impressed by the glorious blue river with swimming spots below the cave, which is why I was determined to do the trip again. The spot now even has a tourist name and is advertised as the Blue Lagoon.

But in the rainy season, everything is a little different here. Back then, it was a bumpy but fairly comfortable ride through the rice fields; today, we had to push our bikes through mud up to our knees in places, and even had to wade through a river, also knee-deep, on the way—almost an adventurous excursion.

The water of the Blue Lagoon is currently more muddy brown than azure, but it is still a beautiful spot where you can cool off in the deep, cool water—and the trip itself leads through breathtakingly beautiful countryside.

Back in town, we had an aperitif at Kangaroo Sunset, a Farang hangout right above the bridge, where you can not only sit comfortably and enjoy the view, but the traveller food is also pretty good and cheap.

After that, we had our bikes thoroughly washed on the main road for 2,000k.

Unfortunately, there was no sign of the famous Vang Vieng sunset on this overcast day, but we still went for dinner at the Sunset Restaurant at our resort, supposedly one of the most popular in town. The view is definitely hard to beat, and the food—although unadventurous tourist fare—was surprisingly tasty and affordable.

We had Chicken with Cashew Nuts (20,000k), Pork Laab (18,000k), and Steamed Fish with fresh Mushrooms in Ginger Sauce (25,000k). And frankly, when I think about what ends up on the table in the simple, local Laotian pubs (fat with bones, offal), I’m happy to be served slightly less authentic, but high-quality Farang cuisine in a beautiful setting.

### Day 17–18 | 29.–30.7. | 30 km  
**Luang Prabang**

Vang Vieng was supposed to be our northernmost point on Highway 13, but I decided that while we were in the area, we simply had to make the detour up to Luang Prabang. Not by bike, though, as that would have meant three days of brutal mountain stages, which I wasn’t prepared to inflict on either Achim or my recently recovered knees.

However, to still properly enjoy the spectacular drive and the breathtaking views, we hired a minibus in Vang Vieng for the 200-kilometre trip. It cost $75, including the driver and fuel, which was a pretty good deal, because even without long breaks, the journey took a good seven hours.

We drove through wild, remote countryside, crossing countless mountain ranges. Along the way, there were only the most basic hilltribe villages with wooden huts, and Highway 13, despite being the country’s main artery, was with very little traffic—a narrow mountain track riddled with potholes.

The former royal capital, Luang Prabang, despite the Mekong and the tarmacked road link, is still the most remote of all the major tourist destinations in Asia. And fortunately, the town still exudes that "end-of-the-world" atmosphere.

Surrounded by mountains, beautifully situated at the confluence of the Mekong and the Nam Khang, Luang Prabang is arguably the most beautiful town in Southeast Asia (perhaps only Hoi An can compete).

With its wonderful flair, peaceful, relaxed atmosphere, magnificent architecture, and numerous dining options, it’s the perfect place for a couple of chilled-out rest days.

I actually liked the city even more this time than on my first visit. During the dry season four years ago, Luang Prabang was very dusty, and it seemed even more touristy then. Right now, it’s surprisingly quiet; there are virtually no tour groups, everything looks wonderfully green and lush, and the old town streets are mostly newly paved, so dust and mud aren’t an issue.

And the overall picture of the city with its old villas, temples, and wooden houses is beautiful anyway. Not even a glossy brochure could depict the Indochina cliché better than it is in reality—the view down from Mount Phousi alone is magical.

Luang Prabang is also excellent for cycling; we rode about 30 kilometres in and around the town. There's no urban traffic to spoil the fun, and there's always something to see: a picturesque temple, a colonial villa hidden under coconut palms, or a beautiful river scene.

What I particularly like about Luang Prabang is that tourism doesn't seem to disrupt the town's balance at all. The old town isn’t an open-air museum; monks inhabit the temples, locals live in the old wooden houses, and the large Phousy Market is so authentic and unspoiled that the photo opportunities alone could fill a memory card.

The fact that tourism can have positive consequences when managed correctly is shown by the city's gastronomic diversity. For a country like Laos, which lags a bit behind the rest of the region culinarily, the situation in Luang Prabang is paradise.

Our gastronomic tour of the city deserves its own chapter:
#### Culinary Stops in Luang Prabang

Sala Café: Perhaps the prettiest café in the city, with comfortable chairs in a small tropical oasis above the Nam Khan. Very good bistro cuisine (Eggplant Salad, 38,000k) and fruit shakes. Prices are high-end, but the portions are generous and the ambience is superb.

3 Nagas: A chic restaurant in a beautiful colonial villa. They exclusively serve traditional Laotian cuisine, but at a very high standard, using the best quality ingredients. The service is attentive, and the prices are correspondingly high, but still reasonable given the quality. The Grilled Buffalo Fillet ($5.40) was absolutely magnificent, and the Steamed Fish in Banana Leaf filled with Pork ($6) was heavenly. The Laab of raw minced beef ($5) was classically delicious. However, I wasn't keen on the traditional Luang Prabang deer stew ($5), which wasn't due to the quality but rather a specific seasoning wood commonly used in Laotian cooking, whose anise-like flavour takes a lot of getting used to.

Tum Tum Cheng: Also located in an old villa on Sakkarine Road, but a little simpler and cheaper than 3 Nagas. They also offer cooking classes—whose most famous participant, according to their own advertising, was Jamie Oliver. Tum Tum Cheng also focuses mainly on traditional Laotian and local cuisine. We only had breakfast here, but what we tried was good and relatively inexpensive. The spring rolls (22,000k) could have been a bit crispier, but the Luang Prabang Noodle Soup (22,000k) was tasty, and the Sticky Rice Salad (25,000k) was a real hit.

Tamnak Lao: Another villa restaurant on Sakkarine Road with a very nice first-floor balcony. This is one of the city's most popular Laotian restaurants, although it also offers Western food. A step down from 3 Nagas in terms of both price and quality, but Tamnak Lao is still recommendable. The standard could be described as "good home-style cooking"; the dishes tasted just like those from a good street food stall. For starters, we had prawns and vegetables in pastry (35,000k) and eggplant dip with baguette. For the main course, there were seasonal local chanterelles with pork (40,000k) and fried fish in ginger sauce (Fragrant Fish, 35,000k). Not outstanding in flavour, but good.

Maylek Pub: This pleasant bar-café had thick cushions for comfortable seating, played Manu Chao, and served a decent Café au Lait (20,000k). Thanks to the cheap drinks, it’s certainly not a bad place to hang out in the evening.

Mekong Riverside Restaurants: The numerous simple eateries along the Mekong can be described as “same same but different.” In the dry season, you can lounge on bamboo mats right by the riverbank, but for now, you have to settle for the promenade. They all offer a relaxed atmosphere, a lovely river view, cheap fruit shakes, and a menu of inexpensive Lao and Farang (Western) standard dishes, which were always perfectly fine taste-wise, and locals like to eat here too. However, the food isn't the main reason to come here; it’s the atmosphere and the cheap beer, which you absolutely must order with the local specialty, Kai Phaen (fried river algae), as a snack. Served with the Cheo Bong dipping sauce, it’s a real delicacy. In my opinion, the nicest spot to sit is at View Kheam Khong.

The Apsara: The smart, stylish restaurant of the boutique hotel of the same name on the Nam Khan is rightly considered one of the best in the city. The small but refined menu offers Far Eastern and Western dishes with a creative touch at higher, but justified, prices. The service is impeccable, and the ambience is lovely. The food quality ranged from faultless (the Thai eggplant salad, $4.50) to very tasty (the Watercress, Blue Cheese, and Walnut Salad, $4.50) and absolutely heavenly. The latter applied to the house speciality: the whole roasted fish for two, stuffed with lemongrass, in a tamarind-garlic sauce. The pleasure cost $12, but the fish was truly huge, with perfect, firm flesh, and the sauce complemented it excellently. A culinary revelation and worth every penny.

We stayed at the Sayo River Guesthouse on the Mekong riverside road. Our very spacious, flawless room was nicely furnished, with two beds, air-con, a fridge, satellite TV, a seating area, and even some artwork. The bathroom with a hot water shower was also massive. Top guesthouse standard for an extremely fair price of $20. Highly recommended.

### Day 19 | 31.7. | 19 km  
**Luang Prabang – Vientiane**

We caught the 6:30 AM bus back to Vientiane. This "VIP bus" (93,000k) was far from luxurious, though. It stopped frequently to pick up or drop off passengers and took a good ten hours for the route. The bikes travelled hassle-free on the roof for 10,000k.

Once in Vientiane, we checked back into the Sengprachanh Hotel and then rode around the city a bit, mostly along the Mekong. The streets in the pretty riverside districts, with their old wooden houses, are still unpaved and have barely changed in recent years.

Numerous simple, but very atmospheric, eateries still line the riverbank west of the old town, where you can enjoy the view over the Mekong with a Lao beer or a fruit shake.

We also had a quick bite at the Mekong Balcony, and what they served was surprisingly good: squid salad and seafood with vegetables for 25,000k each, the view was free, and a bottle of beer only cost 7,000k.

For dinner, we ate at the small, beautifully decorated Saovaly in the old town near the riverside road. This intimate, stylish restaurant attempts creative, international cuisine, and the small menu offers exotic items for this area, like crocodile steak, as well as traditional Laotian fare. We ordered a Laotian chicken breast salad with julienne vegetables (20,000k), Mekong fish fillet with couscous (35,000k), and ostrich fillet with spinach (60,000k). While this didn't meet the highest gourmet standards, it tasted quite good and was nicely presented. The service was friendly and discreet, and the prices were reasonable. A nice find, although we were the only guests there; I hope this little gem manages to survive.

### Day 20 | 1.8. | 150 km  
**Vientiane – Paksan**

The route on Highway 13 eastwards towards Southern Laos is mostly flat and unspectacular; only a few small hills and the rough surface made progress difficult, especially on the second half of the stage.

However, the ride wasn't boring, thanks to the constant chorus of "Sabaidee" (hello) from the children along the way, and you’re always a major attraction during breaks in the villages.

The route was also pleasant to ride due to the almost non-existent traffic.

Paksan is the provincial capital of Bolikhamsay, but it feels more like a sleepy, featureless village on the highway. It is, however, a very friendly place, and the location on the Nam Xay gives Paksan some appeal.

Recently, a genuine mid-range hotel has opened here, the large, Asian-style Paksan Hotel, right on the highway. When I went to check in, I actually thought the hotel wasn't open yet; it looked somewhat deserted and unfinished from the outside. I believe we were the only guests today.

Our room for $15, however, was excellent—a veritable suite, modern and very spacious, with a balcony, two separate sleeping areas, a mini-bar, and a bathtub. Outstanding value for money.

Paksan was also worth the stop for the food. With its terrace right next to the bridge over the river, the Sainamxay Restaurant not only has a great location but also offers first-class fish dishes, and even roasted turtle, which I'd never eaten before.

The main courses cost between 20,000k and 30,000k, which isn’t cheap for the Laotian provinces, but they had an English menu, and the quality of the cooking was absolutely above average.

By the way, turtle tastes like a mix of eel and game—very unusual, but not bad.

### Day 21 | 2.8. | 122 km  
**Paksan – Km 255 (–Thakek)**

We continued south on Highway 13, but today's route was a bit hillier and more scenic. There are numerous rivers in the area, and everything is tropically green right now; plus, we could see the mountain ranges of the Mekong hinterland along the entire way.

The road surface remained very rough and a bit unpleasant to ride on, but at least there are hardly any potholes, unlike on the 13 towards Luang Prabang.

The original plan was to stop at the village of Namthone after about 95 kilometres, but the simple guesthouse there was full because of some event. So, I rode back five kilometres to the nearest guesthouse. They demanded 60,000k for a miserable, small room with a squat toilet and no fan (they wouldn't turn on the air conditioning). An outrage, but I’m sure they knew the guesthouse in Namthone was full.

Since there were no more guesthouses on the entire route until Thakek, 100 kilometres away, the only option was to take the bus. I rode a bit further to Km 255 and flagged down a Songthaew (shared taxi) for the rest of the journey to Thakek (30,000k), where Achim, who had already boarded a bus earlier, was waiting.

The Songthaew ride was very convivial. My fellow passengers passed around a bottle of Lao Lao, a truly foul spirit, and of course, I couldn't avoid drinking with them, so I arrived in Thakek almost drunk. If you’re a teetotaller or a recovering alcoholic, you must have a hard time in Laos, because you're constantly being invited to drink, and you don't want to be rude.

It had gotten quite late, so once we arrived in town, we had little time to find accommodation before dark. Thakek has a genuine backpacker hostel, which is unusual for this rather untouristed area.

The Travel Lodge seems very popular, even though it's awkwardly far from the centre and the rooms are a mixed bag. We took the best they had to offer, with air-con and a hot water shower. It was very spacious with a huge bed, but it looked a bit worn and neglected, with cobwebs in the bathroom and poor water pressure.

On the other hand, the guesthouse has a very nice atmosphere, and the restaurant serves tasty, inexpensive Lao-traveller food of good quality and pleasantly unauthentic (i.e., with proper pieces of meat without fat, bones, or offal). Perfect for solo backpackers and for hanging out with other travellers.

Nevertheless, the higher-quality provincial hotels seem to offer better value for money than this traveller guesthouse. Our room cost 110,000k, not much less than our suite in Paksan.

### Day 22 | 3.8. | 101 km  
**Thakek – Km 257 (–Thakek)**

We cycled the section of Highway 13 that we had missed yesterday by taking the bus, and spent another night in Thakek.

The route wasn't the most pleasant, however: mostly hilly, miles away from the Mekong, with few villages along the way, and often just bushes and trees on both sides of the road.

There were a few nice, flatter sections through rice fields and views of the hill ranges to the east, but these were rare.

Once we reached yesterday's endpoint, we took a Songthaew back to the town. This way, we didn't miss any part of the route to Southern Laos, and after all, there aren’t many roads in the country that are properly rideable right now.

It was great to cycle without luggage today, as I could leave my bags in the room.

We had actually switched accommodation early this morning to be right in the centre, specifically on the Mekong bank, as our current hotel, the Souksomboon, was located in a former Governor's Palace—which, like the rooms, desperately needs a lick of paint.

But the location is perfect, and hotels in stately colonial buildings always have a special atmosphere, luxurious or not. Our room was certainly very spacious with the usual comforts, though the furnishings were aesthetically questionable and disharmonious.

The bathroom was in urgent need of renovation, and there was barely any water pressure in the shower. But when you only pay $12 for a room in a palace, you can make a few compromises; the atmosphere was right, at least.

We spent the entire afternoon in Thakek, exploring the cyclable streets (there aren't too many in the rainy season) on our bikes.

The capital of Khammuane province is a cosy and surprisingly attractive town on the Mekong, with several streets of well-preserved colonial architecture, a quiet riverside road full of potholes and barely any traffic (except for the lorries that cross over from Thailand by ferry).

It was definitely worth stopping in this pleasant, friendly town, as despite the Travel Lodge, it doesn’t seem to see too many Farangs.

We had a quick lunch at the restaurant of the Khammouane Mekong Hotel, the newly renovated premier establishment in town. The associated eatery was very simple, like the rest of the town, but it was open.

Finding an open restaurant at lunchtime in the sleepy old town of Thakek wasn't easy. The food here was cheap and mediocre. The pork with cashews (20,000k) came with peanuts instead, but was tasty. The beef with vegetables (15,000k) was a bit tough.

Dinner at our hotel restaurant, with a view of the illuminated skyline of Nakhon Phanom across the river, was a different matter. Although it was also a very simple open-air spot and the service wasn't brilliant, the food was all the better.

Absolutely fantastic Hotpot/Korean BBQ with tender veal (30,000k) and seafood (40,000k). Not exactly cheap, but the quality was truly high and worth the money.

### Day 23 | 4.8. | 135 km  
**Thakek – Savannakhet**

Cycling down the Mekong on Highway 13 sounds much more pleasant than it is in reality. Today's route was hilly all the way, and the road ran for miles through the hills between Thakek and Savannakhet, away from the river.

On top of that, there was the poor road surface, which hardly lets you roll, and today, we also had a headwind. The scenery wasn't particularly exciting either.

However, Savannakhet is definitely worth a visit. The city is still almost as cosy and sleepy as it was on my first visit. With its very well-preserved old town on the Mekong and the picturesque colonial buildings, it's one of Indochina's more attractive small towns.

Picturesque wooden houses along the narrow, unpaved alleys among coconut palms complete the pretty overall picture. The Mekong bank is lined with street kitchens exuding delicious grilled aromas.

The only, and unfortunately not very positive, change in recent years is the redesign of the city's most beautiful square in front of the cathedral. The new, unsubtle concrete slabs in the middle don't really match the crumbling old houses that line the square.

When I arrived, I had a quick bite at the Lao-Paris Restaurant, a simple traveller café where I'd already spent a few hours four years ago. They still serve very cheap and genuinely decent Lao and Farang food here. This time, I tried the beef in oyster sauce for 12,000k.

Regarding accommodation, Savannakhet still has a lot of catching up to do. The rooms at the recommended Hong Thip Hotel were grossly overpriced at $18 and $25, and apart from that, there are only very basic places in the old town.

Of these, the superbly located Mekong Hotel on the riverside road made the best impression. Our room in the otherwise charming colonial building desperately needed a renovation—the only new accessory, amusingly, was the bathtub, but there was no plug for it.

Otherwise, it had the usual comforts like air-con, a fridge, and a TV, but everything was a little worn and unkempt. On the upside, it was very cheap for $9. It's a shame, really, as they could turn this hotel into a real gem.

For dinner, we ate at one of the numerous simple eateries on the Mekong bank, slightly north of our hotel. They all offer the same thing: Mekong fish and chicken from the grill, plus Som Tam.

Very popular with locals, Beer Lao flows freely here, and the atmosphere is wonderfully authentic. The food is dirt cheap and delicious. A large, grilled fish, which is qualitatively comparable to any high-quality saltwater fish, only cost 18,000k. Som Tam and grilled chicken were 8,000k.

### Day 24 | 5.8. | 145 km  
**Savannakhet – Km 565 (–Pakse)**

Since Savannakhet is off the highway on the Mekong, we first had to ride 35 km on an access road to get back onto the 13. This was also the most scenic stretch, passing through rice fields on a relatively good surface.

The rest of the way was rather boring, with no views and few villages along the roadside.

Today's section was less hilly than the last two days, but progress was again hampered by a headwind and a poor road surface.

Since the last guesthouses were after about 75 kilometres and there was nothing after that, I got on the bus after 137 kilometres and went all the way to Pakse, where there's plenty of accommodation.

What I didn't know was that the bus station is miles outside the centre, so I had to ride almost ten kilometres into the city in the dark.

Achim arrived even later, at 9 PM, as he was 20 kilometres behind me, and my bus had apparently been the last one of the day. He did manage to arrange a private ride in a truck after a two-hour wait, though.

Our room at the centrally located Sang Aroun Hotel was brand new, sparkling clean, and, almost irritatingly, decorated entirely in white and beige.

The hotel has a lobby that could belong to a first-class establishment, but the rooms are more functional and practical than luxurious, though they are certainly worth the $14 price tag.

Since it was so late, we ate Indian at Nazim, which was just a few doors down. Nazim now has branches in all the country's major tourist centres and offers an extensive menu from across the subcontinent here too.

The atmosphere is very simple, but the prices are right: Pakoras, two lamb dishes, Palak Paneer, Garlic and Cheese Nan, plus Lao Beer and two Lassis for €7.

As with my previous visits in Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang, the food wasn't exactly gourmet, but it was solid, tasty, and plentiful. A nice change for the palate.

### Day 25 | 6.8. | 111 km  
**Pakse – Km 565 (–Pakse)**

Just like in Thakek, where we had taken the bus to a larger city for an overnight stay, today was about completing the remaining distance.

It was definitely an advantage to cycle northwards today, as the wind was again blowing quite strongly from the south.

The route, especially the area around Kongxedone, was the most scenic between Vientiane and Pakse. Mostly flat, the with very little traffic highway runs through picturesque rice fields framed by wooded hill ranges.

This time, it was really worth catching up on the missed stretch.

I rode back to Pakse in a hopelessly overcrowded, rattling Chicken Bus for 20,000k.

In the afternoon, there was enough time for a detailed exploration of the city.

Four years ago, Pakse was the only place in the entire country that I genuinely disliked; the city was like one big, dusty construction site with no charm whatsoever, and was unusually hectic and loud for Laos.

A lot has changed in the intervening years, and I have to revise my judgement.

While Pakse offers far fewer picturesque streets with colonial buildings and temples than Luang Prabang or Savannakhet, the city is beautifully situated at the confluence of the Se Done and the Mekong, with imposing mountain ranges in the background, and is by no means unattractive now that the construction sites have vanished.

There are numerous accommodation options, countless restaurants, and a huge, modern shopping complex right in the centre.

Apart from the conveniences of a big city (by Laotian standards), the beautiful location, and some remaining colonial architecture, Pakse's greatest attraction is the Mekong bank with its seafood restaurants and food stalls, which grill fish and chicken in a wonderful atmosphere and serve beer with it.

However, we ate at one of the "better" restaurants on the opposite side of the road, the only one with a Latin script sign. They even had a selection of Australian wines, but the food prices were very moderate.

Two Korean BBQs (Flying Tiger—not recommended, as the name hides undefinable bits of gristle—and Fish, which was very tasty), a fine Turkey Laab, and half a kilo of grilled, fat crayfish cost us €11, including beer and water.

### Day 26 | 7.8. | 62 km  
**Pakse – Champasak**

Cycling southwards out of Pakse sounds much more relaxing than it is. The first almost ten kilometres was probably the busiest, most hectic stretch in all of Laos, with a lot of heavy goods traffic, which fortunately eased significantly after the turn-off towards Khong Province and the Cambodian border.

At Km 30, we turned right off the rather hilly 13 towards the Mekong—a roughly 4 km long tarmacked access road to the archaic ferry, which took us across the river for 5,000k.

On the right bank, we rode another 2 kilometres south, and then we had reached Champasak, the first place that hasn't changed at all in the last four years.

If you disregard the power lines and satellite dishes, you might think the village hasn't changed in over 50 years. More geese and ducks than cars or two-wheelers potter along the narrow street that runs through Champasak.

The old colonial villas picturesquely crumble away between traditional wooden houses. Haste and stress are foreign concepts in this sleepy, idyllic spot where time seems to have stood still.

Although the Wat Phu temple, eight kilometres away, has now been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site and there are numerous guesthouses in Champasak, the village doesn't feel touristy at all; it feels completely authentic, and the locals here are particularly friendly—even the children still greet every passing tourist with countless Sabaidees.

There was one difference from my last visit, though: the scenery looks completely different in the rainy season—stunningly beautiful, to be precise, with shimmering green rice fields and the lushly forested mountain range in the background.

The Wat Phu itself almost looks like a lost jungle temple, nestled amidst dense tropical vegetation—a completely different picture than in April, when the area is brown and dusty, but the trees are beautifully in bloom.

The temple's most unusual feature, which particularly struck me last time, is still there, however. Some joker has put a corrugated iron roof on this richly decorated Khmer temple, which fits like a glove.

If UNESCO is genuinely prepared to revoke the World Heritage status of Cologne Cathedral over planned high-rises or bridges, yet tolerates a rusty, slum-like corrugated iron roof on a thousand-year-old work of art, something must be seriously wrong.

We stayed at the Anouxa GH, about a kilometre before the roundabout, located right on the Mekong. It's almost a luxury resort by Champasak standards, offering generous rooms in terraced bungalows with air-con, a hot water shower, and a large, private veranda facing the river for $15.

The resort restaurant on a terrace by the river only had a small selection of dishes, but the fried fish on a salad of pineapple, onions, and coriander (30,000k) was delicious.

The other dishes—papaya salad (6,000k), fried vegetables (20,000k), and Duck Laab (25,000k)—also tasted quite good, but they were severely lacking in chilli, which could be rectified upon request.

The portions were a bit small and the prices slightly high, but the culinary choice in Champasak is very limited; I didn't even spot any street food stalls.

To celebrate the occasion (2,000 km cycled), we drank a bottle of Laotian wine, "Jewel of the Mekong" (80,000k). I had no idea Laos produced wine and couldn't understand why this alleged Cabernet Sauvignon tasted like port, but never mind—it was quite drinkable with ice.

### Day 27 | 8.8. | 110 km  
**Champasak – Don Khong**

First, we took the ferry back to the other side of the Mekong and then continued south on Highway 13 through sparsely populated territory.

It was a rather boring route, mostly relatively flat, with hardly any traffic or scenic highlights.

After 100 kilometres, a narrow road led one kilometre down to the Mekong, from where the longtail boats depart for Khong Island.

Unfortunately, since no other passengers wanted to cross when I arrived, I had to charter the entire boat for the short crossing, which cost 20,000k.

Khong is the largest island in the beautiful Siphandone area (Four Thousand Islands) and is surprisingly well-developed, with 24-hour electricity and paved little roads that are excellent for cycling through the idyllic landscape.

The island's main village—really not much more than a cluster of wooden houses and a handful of old colonial buildings—now offers numerous guesthouses along the riverbank, most of them new or freshly renovated.

Accordingly, the place is populated by a surprisingly large number of Farangs, mostly middle-aged tourists, with whom the island seems very popular.

Apart from scenic beauty, Don Khong primarily offers peace and a relaxed atmosphere, though it’s not quite as attractive as the islands further south, Don Det and Don Khone.

We took a room at Sala Don Khong, a very pretty auberge situated in two traditional wooden villas on the Mekong bank south of the pier.

This is the island’s premier establishment and hard to beat for atmosphere, with a garden and river view.

The rooms, even the most expensive at $25, are simply furnished but have an old-world charm that fits the region well.

There is no TV or fridge, but there’s art on the walls, beds with mosquito nets, and a wonderful shower that actually delivered a proper jet of water (a rarity in Laos).

We had the cheapest available room with air-con for $13—a very good price for the ambience.

The auberge also has a very appealing colonial-style dining room, but food was only available with an hour’s notice.

So, we first had the day's first meal right in the village on the Mekong terrace of Pon's Guesthouse.

Khong's restaurants cater primarily to tourists, so the menus feature typical Lao-traveller food, which was the case at Pon's. But the food here was very decent and well-seasoned.

We had spring rolls (10,000k), papaya salad (10,000k), fish laab (30,000k), and a whole grilled fish (30,000k), which, as always along the Mekong, tasted superb.

The dining was a notch more upscale in terms of quality and ambience at our auberge, where, for some inexplicable reason, we were the only guests.

Pre-ordering had paid off. The steamed fish in banana leaf (35,000k) literally melted in the mouth, and the coconut fish curry (25,000k) was also delicious.

### Day 28 | 9.8. | 109 km  
**Don Khong – Don Khone**

We cycled almost 30 kilometres on Don Khong in the morning, mostly through rice fields, and then took the ferry back to the mainland from the terminal located a few kilometres south of the village.

After about 5 kilometres, we were back on Highway 13.

I first rode the nearly 30 kilometres down to the Cambodian border to inquire about the best way to get to Stung Treng. I was told there that the road is now in good condition and easily manageable by bike even in the rainy season. Let’s hope that’s true; we’ll certainly give it a try.

I then met Achim again at Southeast Asia’s largest waterfall, a few kilometres further north. The "roar of the Mekong" is more attractive in the dry season, though, partly because the Mekong isn't as muddy brown then, and partly because there are lovely pools for swimming at lower water levels.

To get to Don Det and Don Khone, we had to cycle back a few kilometres on the 13 to the turn-off for Ban Nakasang, from where it was three kilometres of bumpy, sometimes muddy track to the boat landing.

Prices for the crossing seem to be dictated by a cartel here now; 15,000k per person is frankly outrageous, but you get an official ticket, and no one will take you for less.

As we approached Don Det, I barely recognised anything at first. The beautiful beach isn't there in the rainy season, but the number of bungalow complexes has multiplied; almost the entire south bank is now built up, and there are agencies where you can buy package trips all the way to Phnom Penh and even Cambodian visas.

I had to get over this shock first, as on my last stay, there were only a handful of guesthouses with simple huts, no terrace restaurants, and no travel agencies.

This initial impression quickly faded, however, because upon closer inspection, I realised not too much had changed.

There is still no electricity, apart from generators that run for a few hours in the evening; the vast majority of guesthouses still offer the same $1 no-comfort huts, and the scenery is simply fantastic: coconut palms, rice fields, the Mekong, and a few wooden huts—nothing else.

There are also hardly any tourists here right now—pure idyll—although Don Det certainly bursts at the seams during high season, and the peace and quiet are probably gone then, as holidays are virtually impossible to have cheaper than here.

We cycled along the narrow coastal path to the old French bridge, across which we reached Don Khone, the larger of the two islands, with a very picturesque village that still features a few colonial-era buildings.

Here, too, there is no electricity, magical views of a picture-book tropical backdrop, and, oh dear, an internet café—almost an outrage in a paradise of simple living.

Accommodation options on Khone are a little more varied, though less numerous, than on Det.

In addition to the $1 huts, there is the Sala Don Khone with rooms in a lovely colonial villa and the Sala Phae on the river, where we stayed.

The bungalows built on rafts above the water here fall into the category of unique and unforgettable.

Not that they are particularly luxurious—after all, there are only a few hours of electricity, making air-con and TV completely unnecessary—but the furnishings, with a reading nook, Thai cushion, and small veranda with wonderful views, are truly stylish, the atmosphere is unbeatable, and you can jump straight into the river from your room.

At $15 for a room, it’s a small fortune in this area, but Sala Phae is worth every penny—you couldn't find a more romantic place to stay.

Dinner at the associated restaurant was also very decent and inexpensive.

As everywhere, there was delicious Mekong fish, prepared in various ways as Laab (15,000k), steamed in a banana leaf (25,000k), and roasted (25,000k).

But the spring rolls (10,000k) also tasted excellent, as did the pork with basil (15,000k).

<div class="country cambodia">

### Day 29 | 10.8. | 89 km  
**Don Khone – Stung Treng (Cambodia)**

We started today in Ban Nakasang, as the boat driver wouldn't take us to Tha Muang as we wished—annoying, as that pier would have saved us three kilometres of bad track back to the 13. After about 15 kilometres, the highway, which was excellent, wide, and lightly trafficked in this area, ended abruptly, and the last five kilometres to the border were on a dreadfully bad forest path, covered in potholes. The ride was further complicated by the huge potholes being filled with water and sometimes covering the entire width of the path, forcing us to push our bikes in places. It was impossible to believe that this was the road to an international border crossing. But the Immigration Office, consisting merely of a simple wooden hut, did exist. We had to pay the Laotians $2 baksheesh (tip/bribe) for the exit stamp, and I haggled the Cambodians down to $1, but otherwise, the border crossing was quick and trouble-free. If you have enough time and patience, you can probably cross without baksheesh, but we still had 60 kilometres to ride and didn't know the condition of the road, so we didn't want to waste any time.

The first 30 kilometres on the Cambodian side of the highway were newly developed; all that was missing was a paved surface, but the gravel was already firmly pressed, so the road was easy to ride, even if we couldn't go very fast due to the very rough surface. The second half of the route wasn't as far along, but the dust track was sometimes easier and more pleasant to ride, as it was less bumpy and in pretty good condition, with most potholes easily avoidable. The last three kilometres to the ferry to Stung Treng were again in very poor condition. We crossed the surprisingly wide Tonle San, which flows into the Mekong here, on the car ferry (1,000r), and reached our destination for the day.

Stung Treng is an unspectacular, dirty, but quite pleasant provincial town, beautifully situated in the solitude of Cambodia's Northeast. The town's smart houses and power lines looked almost like a mirage, as there was barely more than a handful of the simplest wooden huts off the road on the route from the border. Just a few years ago, Stung Treng was a remote outpost only reachable by boat or hellish pick-up rides from the rest of the country. However, since the border with Laos officially opened and Highway 7 from Kratie is apparently quite good to ride, relatively many travellers spend the night here on their way to Rattanakiri or Laos. Accordingly, there are numerous accommodation options in Stung Treng, and even traveller cafés and internet.

We took a rather nicely furnished room with air-con, TV, and some art on the walls at the Sok Sambath Hotel, the best place in town. The bathroom was a bit simple, without a hot water shower, but overall, the room was fine for $13. The Riverside Guesthouse has a rooftop restaurant where you can enjoy the sunset and the beautiful views. They also have good fruit shakes, but the food—traveller fare—was very average and not cheap. It tasted much better at the simple, small Sophakmukul, a local eatery one block east of the market. Here, we had fried fish in tomato chutney on rice and an interesting, very tasty variation of Amok for 4,000r each.

### Day 30 | 11.8. | 40 km  
**Stung Treng – (Kratie)**

Since I didn't trust the road to Kratie—rightly so, as it turned out—we originally wanted to take the passenger ferry down the Mekong. However, this service was discontinued last year, as the bus is now faster and cheaper anyway. A shame, really; the boat trip would certainly have been lovely. So, we took the bus, which called itself a "VIP Bus" but was basically a regular air-conditioned coach—quite comfortable for Cambodia. The journey cost $5 (plus $5 for the bikes, which were stored in the aisle) and surprisingly only took two and a half hours.

Large sections of the road are already finished, but the parts that haven't been gravelled and pressed yet are currently in a catastrophic state, so it was a good decision not to cycle, especially not 150 kilometres. In two or three years, however, it will certainly be a beautiful route.

We arrived in Kratie by 10 AM and took a room at the brand new Oudom Sambath Hotel, centrally located on the riverside road. The room was right up on the rooftop terrace, which offered wonderful views of the Mekong. The facilities were flawless, modern, and clean, with air-con, TV, and a large bathroom with a hot water shower. A good deal for $12.

Kratie is an attractive provincial town with numerous surviving colonial-era buildings and beautiful wooden villas characteristic of this region. However, the town is on the tourist map due to the Irrawaddy Dolphins that frolic in the river north of the city. Unfortunately, the whole thing is now a bit of a tourist trap, and they're heavily cashing in ($2 for foreigners just for the right to take a boat to the dolphins!! - and then another $5 per person for the short trip). Knowing Cambodia, the money certainly doesn't benefit the dolphins. I was lucky enough to see these nice creatures in Laos, so I could bear to miss out this time; you don't have to participate in every rip-off.

However, the route on the small, bumpy riverside road (Highway 7) is well worth it on its own, especially by bike. It passes through incredibly picturesque villages with locals greeting you, past beautiful wooden villas and simple huts under coconut and banana trees. You could fill an entire memory card here in 20 kilometres, with so many cliché-beautiful motifs.

Culinary-wise, things are still a little meagre in Kratie. The city's two backpacker guesthouses offer traveller food at slightly inflated prices—very good at Star GH, very bad at You Hong GH—and you sit most comfortably on cushioned wicker chairs. The selection of local eateries isn't very large, so we tried the Pencheth Restaurant for dinner, attached to the city's most popular hotel, the Santepheap, on the riverside road. The decision proved an excellent one. Although the ambience was far from appealing, the cuisine met the highest standards. Both the salad of raw, marinated fish and the raw marinated beef were absolutely delicious (8,000r each), and the local interpretation of Amok (of which there seem to be countless ways of preparation) was extremely tasty, with beautifully firm fish in a coconut-peanut sauce. The food here was more than worth the price—a shame about the atmosphere, or rather, the lack thereof.

### Day 31 | 12.8. | 131 km  
**Kratie – Memot**

Highway 7 from Kratie down to Phnom Penh is in excellent condition by Cambodian standards and surprisingly lightly trafficked. The route is also not as isolated as north of Kratie. The first 50 kilometres or so were predominantly flat, but before Snoul—one of the most dilapidated, dirty places I have ever encountered—the landscape began to become hilly, and there were numerous short, steep, but also long, drawn-out climbs and descents to tackle.

Scenically, the route wasn't exceptionally appealing; around Memot, rubber plantations largely dominate the landscape. On the upside, breaks were always entertaining, as being a Farang on a bike in this area of Cambodia seems to be a bigger sensation than even in Laos. Some children even forget to greet you and just stare open-mouthed.

The market town of Memot is one of those places you would never stop at unless you were travelling by bike, which is why you are still a massive attraction as a Farang here. However, I always find it interesting to stroll through the market and streets in such a completely untouristed town.

Memot is only marginally more attractive than Snoul; there are a few run-down old Chinese shophouses around the large market, which is unspeakably dirty but also very photogenic. Otherwise, Memot looks poor and featureless. However, there is a relatively new guesthouse here, the Reaksmey Angkor, in the largest building in town, located right by the market and the highway. This is certainly one of the best accommodations in rural Cambodia, with simply furnished and small rooms, but modern and clean for $10 with air conditioning. The shower was a little weak, unfortunately, although only cold water was available anyway.

Food was easily found. At the market, there were delicious baguettes and fruit shakes, and a simple hole-in-the-wall eatery, the Soy Try, was located just east of our hotel on the highway. There was no English menu, but that's exactly why you carry a dictionary. We eventually had fried fish, fried rice with chicken, and surprisingly tender beef with vegetables. The food tasted good and was cheap (3,000–5,000r per dish).

In Memot, I finally managed to track down two SIM cards today ($26 with $14 credit)—no easy feat in Cambodia, as, theoretically, you can only get a card with a Cambodian ID, which foreigners don't have. After countless unsuccessful attempts at the many available phone shops, both in Kratie and here, one finally took pity and was content with a copy of my passport and two signatures. That's just how it is in Cambodia: with patience, persistence, and perhaps a little baksheesh, you can generally get what you want, regulations notwithstanding.

### Day 32 | 13.8. | 103 km  
**Memot – Kompong Cham**

The first 30 kilometres to Krek were still hilly, but the climbs became shorter and less frequent the further west we rode. The route from Krek was already familiar to us from the spring, mostly flat, and the last 15 kilometres into Kompong Cham had an excellent road surface. The same couldn't be said for the section between Memot and Krek; the road here was bumpier than yesterday, with many ruts where water could collect.

We didn't stay at the Mekong Hotel by the river this time, but at the Phnom Prosh Hotel. Less well located and by no means "posh," it nevertheless had the best $10 rooms in the city—spacious and modern, with a fridge, air-con, and a good shower. The only flaw was the non-functioning bathroom light. Otherwise, a very good deal.

Kompong Cham is excellent for cycling—a very pleasant town on the Mekong, clean by Cambodian standards, where a new riverside promenade is currently being built, which will certainly further enhance the city's already attractive overall look. Some of the French colonial buildings that characterise the centre around the large market have also been renovated, so Kompong Cham could blossom into a very handsome town.

Since we had a decent meal last time at Hoa An, one of the very few centrally located restaurants in the city, we didn't want to take any risks—however, we had a bad experience this time. The fried vegetables were quite good, but the grilled fish (15,000r) was burnt, and the third dish we ordered never arrived—the service is still an absolute disaster.

In contrast, our hotel restaurant was far better in terms of cuisine and service. I'm not a big fan of hotel restaurants, as the atmosphere is usually not great, but lately, despite the less-than-charming ambience, we've always eaten excellently at hotels. The same was true here: salads of raw marinated fish and beef (8,000r) and fresh mushrooms stir-fried (6,000r). Absolutely delicious, and the portions were absolutely gigantic, so the prices were extremely cheap. A total hit!

### Day 33 | 14.8. | 140 km  
**Kompong Cham – Skoun – Kompong Thom**

We first continued for another 50 kilometres on Highway 7 to Skoun, mostly flat on a good surface. The 7 ended here, and we followed Highway 6 north to Kompong Thom. This road is also now easily passable, albeit quite narrow and busy. The route was very scenic, with a beautiful mix of rice fields and coconut palms typical of Central Cambodia—flatlands as far as the eye could see.

There was a shorter route to Kompong Thom, Highway 71. However, since this is not yet completely paved and it had rained all night, that shortcut would probably have been much more unpleasant to ride.

Kompong Thom is not exactly the most attractive Cambodian provincial capital. There are few old colonial buildings and beautiful wooden villas to admire; the town is rather featureless, functional, and the busy Highway 6 runs right through the centre. Nevertheless, Kompong Thom is not a bad place to stop overnight. There are numerous accommodation options, a large market, and the town is situated on a river, which usually gives even less magnificent places a certain appeal.

We stayed at the Mitthepheap Hotel, right behind the bridge, about 500 metres from the market. They had the typical Cambodian $10 rooms—simple but clean and modern, with air-con, a fridge, and satellite TV—good shower.

The food we ate was less good: the restaurant belonging to the Arunras Hotel next to the market seems to be the most popular eatery in town, but the food was below average, and most dishes on the very extensive menu weren't even available. The Fried Mushrooms with Beef used canned mushrooms, and we'd had better versions of the Fried Fish with Ginger. At around 6,000r per dish, at least it wasn't expensive.

### Day 34 | 15.8. | 151 km  
**Kompong Thom – Siem Reap**

For me, today was by far the toughest day of the entire tour, as pretty much all functions of my rear wheel gave up the ghost during the ride. The freehub had stopped working long ago, and today the discs that stabilise the wheel came loose, and the gear cable was also defective. So, I struggled against a headwind over the long distance with a temporarily taped rear wheel that wobbled like a cow's tail, sometimes rubbed against the frame, and all this without much ability to shift gears, and without a rear brake.

Fortunately, the route was completely flat, and the road surface was in good condition overall, apart from a few slightly bumpy patches. Nevertheless, we only arrived in Siem Reap just before dark and checked into the Oriental — well, not really: that was just the name of our room at the Dead Fish Inn, an quirky guesthouse on Sivatha Road, centrally located on the edge of the small old town.

The room ($20) was well-equipped with three beds, a seating area with a sofa, TV, air-con, and even carpeted floor. The brick wall also gave the room a flair that you don't find in standard hotels. The only things to complain about were the very small bathroom and the lack of a window.

What there is to say about Siem Reap I will report in detail tomorrow, as I'll spend the day in the city and won't be visiting Angkor again. My priority, in any case, is getting my bike repaired first.

### Day 35 | 16.8. | 23 km  
**Siem Reap**

Even during last night's stroll through the Old Town, I could hardly believe my eyes. It's astonishing how dramatically a city's look and vibe can shift in just a handful of years. Six years ago, I wrote about Siem Reap: "a cosy little provincial town on the river... but a few restaurants offering Western cuisine already hint at what to expect here in the coming years: mass tourism." Granted, that wasn't a particularly daring prediction, but the extent of this metamorphosis has genuinely astonished me, especially since even on my second visit three years ago, there was only a rather inconspicuous development—a few more restaurants and hotels, but Siem Reap was still relatively quiet and primarily the place where you stay when you visit Angkor.

Siem Reap is now a veritable metropolis by Cambodian standards; new neighbourhoods are being conjured up in the suburbs, there must be well over 100 hotels now, and the number of construction sites suggests that the boom is nowhere near ending. However, the traffic and noise are already reaching unpleasant levels.

These rather negative aspects only partially affect the old town. This area, after a complete overhaul, is now a first-rate tourist attraction, even without perhaps the grandest temple complex in the world right on its doorstep. Streets are lined with old, restored colonial buildings housing a huge number of beautiful, cosy cafés, chic restaurants, pubs, and chill-out lounges. Where, in 2000, in the rather run-down area around the old market, there was exactly one bar (Angkor What?, but much more modest), and barely more than a handful of Western-run eateries, today you are spoiled for choice—you could easily spend a month here just eating and drinking.

Siem Reap has truly transformed into a very attractive feel-good city and—oh yes—there are also a few nice old temples to visit nearby. The price level in the city's smart establishments is relatively high for Southeast Asian standards, especially for European cuisine, but of course still much lower than at home. However, you can drink here really cheaply, as the huge competition brings with it generous, long Happy Hours and Beer Specials. A glass of draft beer is available here for as little as 25 cents—not in a cheap pub with plastic chairs, mind you, but in a prime location on Bar St (a pedestrian zone in the evening) in cushioned wicker chairs.

I spent the whole day in Siem Reap today while Achim looked at the temples. After seeing the tourist crowds at the entrance to Angkor, I was glad to have visited the temples in a peaceful, quiet atmosphere in time, and felt no desire to see them a third time, not under these conditions. So, I had my bike repaired, rode a few kilometres through the town, past luxury hotels and neighbourhoods of wooden shacks, and along the river, where you can sit and rest nicely on the bank.

In the afternoon, I left the bike and strolled through the old town on foot, stopping occasionally at a café to eat or drink a quick bite, and looked at the beautiful, authentic Old Market at my leisure. However, due to the numerous beggars and Tuk Tuk/Motodop drivers who constantly accost you every few metres, exploring the city by bike is more relaxing than on foot.

Due to the huge offering, Siem Reap again deserves an extra culinary chapter, although it must be said that the majority of the old town’s cafés and restaurants, however beautiful and cosy they all are, fall into the category of: "same, same but only slightly different."

#### Culinary Stops in Siem Reap

Dead Fish Restaurant: This huge, originally furnished restaurant belonged to our guesthouse. It had seating cushions on wooden platforms, seating areas over small, water-filled basins, or regular tables with comfortable chairs. At night, the place turns into a cocktail bar and beer pub. The menu mainly offers Thai dishes, but also local food like Amok. Prices are at the usual, slightly upscale Siem Reap level (mains between $3–$6), with good quality cuisine.

Le Tigre de Papier: Khmer restaurant and cooking school on Bar St. Cosy wicker chairs and a prime people-watching location. Tasty, quite authentic cuisine at acceptable prices; a glass of beer with the meal was 50 cents. Decent spring rolls ($2.50), fine Khmer Beef Curry ($3), and a generous portion of mixed, good-quality meat for self-grilling ($5).

Red Piano: Perhaps the most beautiful and cosiest café-restaurant on Bar St. We didn't eat here, though. Not a particularly good Cappuccino ($1.50), high-end pricing.

Blue Pumpkin: Not an ideal location on a rather busy street, but stylishly and very cosily furnished inside. A bakery with discreet big-city chic. Decent Pita Sandwiches ($3–$4) and tasty health shakes.

Le Grand Café: Classically chic café in a colonial villa by the old market. It's a really nice and comfortable place to sit, and the service is impeccable. However, this is also the most expensive establishment in the area, with inflated drink prices and very unspectacular food; a rather bland tourist Amok costs over $5 here.

Easy Speaking Pub: This place has the cheapest beer on Bar St. A glass of beer with the meal was just 25 cents. You also sit comfortably here, and the food prices are moderate. It is hardly gourmet cuisine, but the fried fish and grilled beef (both $3) were great as a snack with beer.

Kampuccino: A simpler café-restaurant with Western and Khmer cuisine in a beautiful, shaded old colonial building by the river. Decent coffee and good, relatively inexpensive food. The fried chicken with basil tasted authentically Khmer ($2), and the Mediterranean Platter offered fresh pita and very tasty dips like hummus, eggplant mousse, and couscous salad for $5.50. Highly recommended!

Angkor Palm: Newly opened, higher-end establishment next to the Blue Pumpkin. You don't sit as nicely outside here as on Bar St or the Alley, but the interior is very nicely furnished. The food quality is a step above the usual standard in the area, so the prices are absolutely justified. All the dishes we ordered tasted excellent, especially the raw marinated beef salad ($4) and the beef fillet in pepper sauce ($5.50, including a glass of red wine). They also have good spring rolls, especially the fresh ones ($2.50). Angkor Palm currently has perhaps the best cuisine in the area around the Old Market.

### Day 36 | 17.8. | 25 km  
**Siem Reap – Battambang**

To avoid the inexplicably still poor road between Siem Reap and Sisophon, we opted for the boat to Battambang today ($13). We first cycled a good twelve kilometres down to the pier on the Tonle Sap, a very scenic ride through the countryside along the river. The final three kilometres, however, were very bumpy on an unpaved track.

The boat trip from Siem Reap to Battambang is deservedly popular despite the inflated price, especially the last section on the Stung Sanker river, which is extremely charming. Inexplicably, the journey took eight hours today, nearly twice the usual time during the rainy season. Perhaps the driver was simply conserving fuel. We were also dropped off in a village a good eight kilometres short of Battambang, for which there was also no explanation. Since we had bikes, this wasn't a major issue.

About two kilometres of the road into Battambang were completely flooded—so deep that children were swimming and we had to push our bikes through waist-deep water in places. It was a wonderful experience. Even in the city itself, some streets were underwater, despite the weather being sunny and hot for the past two days.

Ultimately, we didn't reach our hotel, the Royal, until about 4 PM—leaving little time for sightseeing. Fortunately, I’ve been here twice before, as Battambang truly is a very pleasant town. It's nice to see the place hasn't changed much over the last few years. The country's second-largest city is still defined by its colonial architecture, with no high-rises. Only the traffic has increased sharply; Battambang certainly can't be called quiet and sleepy anymore. Nonetheless, the city attracts a growing number of tourists without losing its beautiful, authentic atmosphere. I really love this city.

The Royal Hotel has become the most popular choice, overtaking the Chhaya, offering relatively comfortable, spacious rooms with air conditioning, a fridge, and a TV for $15.

We cycled around the city until dark and stopped at the ASEAN Beer Restaurant across the river. I visited here three years ago for a few pitchers of Anchor (8,000r); back then, we were stared at as if we were from the moon, but now more Farangs seem to venture to the other side. The ASEAN is an authentically local, more upscale beer hall and restaurant, complete with beer girls and a stage for live bands. The food is also very good, with finely prepared Khmer standards like Frog Curry ($2) and fried fish ($2).

I tried the White Rose for the first time today; the city’s most famous eatery is deservedly packed most of the time, as the food is both good and cheap, and the selection is endless. We ordered three dishes at 6,000r each: Beef Luc Lac, fried fish with peppers, and fresh fried mushrooms—all perfectly prepared.

The food is slightly better, however, at the Smoking Pot diagonally across, which is my favourite restaurant in Battambang. Just three years ago, we were the only customers during two visits to this simple "hole-in-the-wall" spot, which also offers cooking classes. Now, you often have to wait for a free table, even during the rainy season—a testament to enduring quality. Positively, the low prices have remained unchanged. The Special Volcano BBQ is still delicious, featuring finely marinated beef (10,000r).

### Day 37 | 18.8. | 112 km  
**Battambang – Pursat**

Highway 5 between Battambang and Phnom Penh used to be the worst road I'd ever experienced—six years ago, a horrific, brutal ride in a pick-up truck through potholes bigger than bomb craters, dust, and mud. And today? It's an excellent, paved, and wonderfully smooth highway, flat and unremarkable—what a change. It took me barely more time on the bike for the nearly 110 kilometres to Pursat than the pick-up did back then.

Pursat, if you only see it from the highway, isn't particularly attractive, but the centre is a good distance off the main road and is quite pleasant. Besides strolling through the exotic and chaotic market, there isn't much to do, but Pursat offers some beautiful photo opportunities: colonial villas by the river, traditional wooden houses under coconut palms, and the sight of snakes and skinned eels in the market.

It also has good accommodation and numerous restaurants. We stayed in a room at the Vimeantip Hotel, which is quiet yet close to the market. It was modern but a bit small and simply equipped, lacking a fridge or a hot shower. Just a typical air-conditioned $10 provincial room.

Next door, in a charming traditional wooden villa, they served simple, authentic Khmer cuisine for 5,000r per main course. It belongs to an NGO, and part of the profit goes to the community, hence the name Community Villa. The sour dip with the fried fish was especially delicious, not to mention the green papaya salad for only 1,000r—a steal.

We also had a decent dinner at the Reaksmey Angkor Restaurant. This eatery is part of the popular Phnom Pech Hotel, whose rooms are too expensive for what they offer (which is why we skipped staying there). However, the food prices are fair. They serve the usual standards like fried fish (7,000r) and Beef Luc Lac with fries (5,000r), and they are quite good.

### Day 38 | 19.8. | 110 km  
**Pursat – Kompong Chhnang**

Highway 5 between Pursat and Kompong Chhnang is currently not in the best shape—very rough and bumpy, with many potholes—but the scenery is beautiful, especially as views of low hill ranges occasionally interrupt the endless flatlands. The road itself, however, only went over some very small hills on the final stretch before Kompong Chhnang.

We booked a room at the Sokha GH, which is nicely situated in a very quiet neighbourhood in the south of the very spread-out town, nestled among old wooden and colonial villas under coconut palms. The room was a bit small but very clean, with air conditioning and a fridge. For $12, there was no hot shower, but since it had been so sunny and hot all day, we didn't need one.

Kompong Chhnang was great for cycling, as the town stretches for several kilometres down to the Tonle Sap. There is a market and food stalls along the lakeshore. Although the area isn't particularly attractive, there are beautiful views over the lake, and the stilt houses are good photo subjects.

The actual city centre is a few kilometres west on Highway 5 and felt almost elegant, with wide avenues, large squares and parks, and colonial-era villas among the palms. That makes Kompong Chhnang sound more attractive than it actually is, though. Most of the colonial buildings are administrative offices and fenced off, the squares feel empty, and there is little for tourists to do here—hardly any restaurants and certainly no nice cafés.

The Mekong Restaurant, where we had dinner, was on the highway and seemed to cater primarily to buses and trucks stopping for lunch. It had a very limited (but at least English) menu with Khmer standards, and the food (we had Fried Fish for 10,000r and Beef Luc Lac for 8,000r) was okay, but too expensive.

### Day 39 | 20.8. | 101 km  
**Kompong Chhnang – Phnom Penh**

The 90 or so kilometres on the fairly decent Highway 5 into Phnom Penh were easy cycling—mostly flat and scenically beautiful. The last few kilometres into the city were a bit tricky as the traffic increased sharply and the road was narrow and bumpy in parts. Nonetheless, I arrived at Sisowath Quay before 11 AM and first enjoyed the comfortable wicker chairs with cushions at one of the many nice cafés on the promenade. My search for a perfect cappuccino at El Mundo was unsuccessful—though it was quite decent—but the tacos filled with minced meat ($3.75) were tasty and substantial.

We again took a room directly on Sisowath Quay. While prices are higher here, it is definitely the most attractive part of the city. The Paragon Hotel, which stands where there was a construction site a few months ago, is perfectly located, with modern, quite comfortable, if slightly small, rooms ranging from $15–$30. I negotiated a price of $20 for our room, which had a window, fridge, and a very nice bathroom—a great price for the area given the standard. The biggest drawback of the Paragon is the lack of a lift, as the stairs are very steep.

We had lunch at Bopha Phnom Penh, an elegant restaurant right on the river next to the pier. It offers a classic Indochina ambience with comfortable lounge chairs, attentive service, and beautifully presented, upscale Khmer cuisine at very reasonable prices for the setting. The fish salad served in a banana leaf ($3) was delicious, and the two main courses, fried vegetables with cashews and beef with eggplant (both $4.50), were also delightful. In the afternoon, we cycled to Boeung Kak Lake to relax in a hammock and enjoy the lovely view. The perfect spot is the simple, stilt-built Sunrise Café, tucked away behind the mosque. They offer cheap shakes and inexpensive traveller food in a relaxed atmosphere—a nice contrast to the more upscale cafés by the river.

Afterward, it was time for Happy Hour at FCC; the cocktails are still good, and the atmosphere is wonderful, but I was a little disappointed by the much-praised wood-fired pizza. It tasted quite good, but for $7.50, I would have expected at least Italian quality. Only the topping provided that (Parma ham, mushrooms, capers, olives, and rocket); the dough, unfortunately, wasn't great. Dinner, in contrast, was excellent again at Malis, probably still Phnom Penh's best restaurant. This time, we ordered the roasted beef in bamboo ($8.80), Fish Amok ($4.90), Prawn-Papaya Salad ($6), and once again the exquisite scallops from Sihanoukville ($4.90).

### Day 40 | 21.8. | 94 km  
**Phnom Penh – Takeo**

We decided to have breakfast today, making the most of the comfort of Phnom Penh. The new Fresco in the FCC Building is exactly the kind of café Sisowath Quay needed. It's a chic deli with genuine, expertly prepared Illy Cappuccino ($2) and build-your-own sandwiches. They offered a very high-quality selection, from smoked salmon to Parma ham and fresh goat cheese on focaccia, baguette, or panini. Expensive ($4.25), but delicious. They should definitely get comfortable wicker chairs with cushions for the outdoor area to make it perfect.

Since our destination, Takeo, was only about 80 kilometres away, I spent the entire morning in Phnom Penh, cycling around and stopping at "The Shop" on St 240 and the Riverside, which, in my opinion, is still the nicest of the wicker-chair café-restaurants on the promenade. The Shop is also a very pleasant, cosy breakfast spot with a bakery in an old colonial house. The Yogurt-Mango Shake ($1.70) was fantastic, and the fresh baked goods looked very tempting. Before leaving, I had a quick lunch at Friends Restaurant, one of Phnom Penh's most famous eateries—a non-profit operation that trains street children for the hospitality industry. This simple but nice restaurant is located in an old house near the National Museum, and if eating for a good cause always meant eating this well, the world would surely be a better place. The dishes on the menu are called tapas but are more like full portions (raciones) in size. The cuisine is international, and the prices are very modest for Phnom Penh. I ordered ravioli stuffed with Chinese mushrooms and spinach with tomato salsa and basil ($2.50), which were superbly tasty. The Cambodian coriander fish salad ($2) also tasted very good; while a little more chilli wouldn't have hurt, it was fine since they mainly cook for tourists here.

The ride to Takeo on Highway 2 wasn't entirely easy. The route, which had several turns, was poorly signposted, and the road, though paved, was in poor condition with numerous potholes. However, the area is pancake-flat, and the route mostly took us right through the rice fields. Despite its proximity to the capital, Takeo is truly deep in the provinces—a quiet, sleepy little place with absolutely nothing to do. But like most Cambodian provincial towns, Takeo is a pleasant, charming spot where old French colonial buildings crumble under coconut palms and things shut down around 8 PM. Thanks to its cosy atmosphere and picturesque setting surrounded by flooded fields, Takeo is a good place to spend a few hours and the night. The not-very-inviting-looking but decent Mittepheap Hotel by the Independence Monument had simple $10 provincial standard rooms with air-con and a TV but no hot shower. We even found a good restaurant right on the lakefront. Built on stilts over the water, the Stung Takeo is not only idyllic but also offered an English menu and decent provincial food at low prices. A large grilled fish with lovely firm meat was 8,000r, the same price as the deliciously marinated grilled pork, which tasted excellent.

---

### Day 41 | 22.8. | 97 km  
**Takeo – Kampot**

The first 13 kilometres on the narrow access road between Takeo and Highway 3 were so bumpy that riding on the unpaved roadside was more comfortable. This situation only slightly improved on the 3 toward Kampot; even on the paved section here, the ride was sometimes so jarring that I often preferred to cycle on the track next to the highway. However, the scenery was beautiful again—vibrant rice fields, green hills, a truly rural tropical idyll.

Time still seems to stand still in Kampot. The town has barely changed in the last six years; even the traffic is still very moderate, and today we had no electricity all day. Given the city's great tourist potential and the current tourism boom in Cambodia, it is very surprising that Kampot still has very few traveller-oriented dining options; there have only been two new openings since last year, while the Espresso Bar on the promenade has closed. This area by the river and the Old Town behind it, with its colonial streets, offers endless possibilities for a wonderful café and restaurant scene. Tourists certainly come here now. On the other hand, Kampot has a lot of charm in its original state and is certainly one of the friendliest towns in the country.

We stayed at the Borey Bokor Hotel. Its rooms may not be the prettiest and most atmospheric in town (that honour goes to the Bokor Mountain Lodge), but they are the most comfortable, and the price is right. A clean, modern room with air-con, fridge, wood panelling, and a hot water shower cost $15.

We had dinner at Ta Euv, north of the bridge on the river. I had good food here last year at very reasonable prices, and the riverside location with a view of the Elephant Mountains is magnificent. The restaurant is popular with locals and tourists alike and offers excellent provincial cuisine with an emphasis on seafood. For three grilled fish, grilled squid, dried shrimp salad, beer, and water, we paid just $10. The most comfortable seating on the promenade was at Say Sa Bok, the ideal spot for a few happy hour drinks with a river view, and currently unchallenged since the Rusty Keyhole closed.

### Day 42 | 23.8. | 73 km  
**Kampot – Kep – Kampot**

I had originally planned to cycle up the road to Bokor Hill Station today, but quickly abandoned the idea, as it was changeable and rainy for the first time after a week of sunny weather. Under these circumstances, cycling into the national park, which was shrouded in dark clouds, would have been foolish. So, I first had breakfast at the newly opened Lucki Food near the Old Market—the town's second Indian-Ceylonese eatery, and ideal for breakfast as the full menu is available early in the morning, and they serve fine Masala Chai in a pot. The Fried Dhal with Chapati ($2.50) was decent, but this is not a place for high culinary demands; rather, they offer cheap drinks and a free beer or samosa with every meal, which is necessary since the food prices aren't particularly low.

After breakfast, I set off to meet Achim in Kep; I was only there last year, and it's not exactly a spectacular place, but the good 50 kilometres return is a beautiful ride through charming, idyllic countryside on a lightly trafficked road. Moreover, Kep offers cheap seafood with a sea view; we bought two kilos of fried crabs and two large mussels for €7 and ate them on one of the wooden platforms with hammocks—my crab needs are definitely satisfied for this year. The revival of the former upscale seaside resort is progressing rapidly, which is still a mystery to me due to the lack of beaches. Two new resorts have been built since last year, and a third is almost finished. However, none of the numerous old French beach villas seem to be renovated, so Kep still has a bit of a ghost town feel.

Back in Kampot, we went for a drink at the Rusty Keyhole, a nice pub on the promenade, and then to the Bokor Mountain Lodge for the sunset. This guesthouse in a beautifully renovated colonial villa by the river not only has the most atmospheric (though unfortunately slightly too expensive) rooms in the city but also the chicest restaurant—though in a traditional town like Kampot, this just means a beautiful setting and cloth napkins. The food was quite good and not overly expensive. Large, crispy spring rolls were $2; the crisp, fresh salad with high-quality beef strips cost $3—it only came under a misleading name (I imagine something different under "spicy beef salad"), but it tasted good nonetheless. Just like the Chicken Tro (mild Khmer coconut curry with pineapple and fried chicken, $3.50). Cheap drinks completed the positive overall impression ($1.50 for a Gin & Tonic). We had a nightcap again at Say Sa Bok, where, incidentally, you also eat very decently (grilled squid, prawns with cashews, both $3) and they mix inexpensive, and generously strong, cocktails (the Kampot River with Jackie, Kahlua, and milk for $2 was very tasty).

---

### Day 43 | 24.8. | 20 km  
**Kampot – Phnom Penh**

We took the bus back to Phnom Penh at half-past seven in the morning. However, it did not take the shortest route on Highway 3 but went via Kep and Kompong Trach on Highway 31, which is inexplicably in significantly better condition—this would have been the better alternative by bike from Takeo. The journey was still time-consuming; the bus ($4) took almost five hours to Phnom Penh. We checked back into the Paragon Hotel and arranged for a visa for Vietnam, which was delivered without problems within a few hours, for a surcharge, of course ($45).

For lunch, we went to Khmer Borane. They offer upscale, very tasty local specialities in a pretty villa on the promenade. The restaurant, however, was very simply furnished; if it were full, it would feel very cramped, so eating here at lunchtime was a good decision. The cuisine, however, was exquisite, and the prices for a riverfront location were very moderate, making Khmer Borane one of the best addresses for Khmer cuisine in Phnom Penh. We had marinated fish salad ($2.70), Teok Krung (marinated minced meat skewers, $2.40), and Tra Sach Ko ($2.90)—an interesting, thick soup of coconut milk, fish, and pork, served with raw vegetables. In the afternoon, we went shopping at the Russian Market.

In the evening, we ate on Sisowath Quay again, this time in the northern part, at the Riverhouse. This is probably the most elegant establishment in the area, a stylishly decorated restaurant with a menu of selected French, Mediterranean, and Asian dishes. The Riverhouse is one of the more expensive places in the city, but the quality of the cuisine was compelling, with excellent ingredients prepared flawlessly. As hors d'oeuvres, we ordered a fine Vegetarian Mezze Marocain ($8) and Artichoke Mousse with Smoked Salmon ($6.90). The main courses were chicken breast stuffed with spinach and pine nuts ($10.90) and, as a highlight, homemade Terrine de Foie Gras ($10.90). The fact that we stayed under €40 despite numerous alcoholic drinks was due to the generous Happy Hour, which lasts from 3 PM to 9 PM here. The cocktails ($3.50–$4.00 for two) tasted decent and were strong. We had a nightcap at the Riverside Bistro, still the nicest and most comfortable of the "same same but different wicker-chair corner cafés" along the riverfront. However, you should definitely skip the German Potato Salad—with mayo and apples—that's simply unacceptable.

## Vietnam

<div class="country vietnam">

### Day 44 | 25.8. | 95 km  
**Phnom Penh – Neak Luong – Chau Doc**

Since the rip-off ferry that travels directly from Phnom Penh to Chau Doc actually demanded $7 per bike for transport, we decided to make the trip on our own. We first rode for about 60 kilometres on the fairly decent Highway 1 to Neak Luong on the Mekong, where we chartered a Speed Boat to the Vietnamese border for $22. The border crossing in this rather remote area was surprisingly quick and problem-free, especially considering the Vietnamese bureaucracy—luggage was scanned, and that was it. Entering Vietnam via this Mekong border is perhaps the most beautiful way to arrive. Firstly, the approximately one-hour boat trip is very picturesque, and secondly, you land directly in a very unspoiled part of the Mekong Delta, inhabited by the friendliest people imaginable. From the border to Chau Doc was another approximately 30 kilometres on narrow, scenic country roads with two ferry crossings.

In Chau Doc, we stayed again at the Trung Nguyen Hotel for $15 in the same room as we had in the spring. For dinner, we also relied on the tried-and-tested. The rustic Mekong Restaurant, more of a street stall in a courtyard surrounded by beautiful colonial buildings, once again served up excellent Delta cuisine. Besides the wonderful spring rolls (25,000d), the Bo Nuong La Cach (grilled beef wrapped in cigar shapes, 30,000d) and the sautéed mussels (25,000d) were particularly good.

---

### Day 45 | 26.8. | 125 km  
**Chau Doc – Long Xuyen – Sa Dec – Vinh Long**

In the morning, we cycled almost 60 kilometres down the Bassac River on the excellent Highway 91 to Long Xuyen. Here, we initially boarded the wrong ferry and, after the boat caught fire and had to anchor mid-river, ended up on one of the numerous islands. Fortunately, the ferries in the Mekong Delta run very regularly, and we were immediately able to return to Long Xuyen and take the correct boat to the other side of the Bassac at the pier east of the market. Here, we rode a pretty, narrow road for about seven kilometres heading south, and after another short river crossing on an old ferry, we reached Highway 80, which we followed to Sa Dec. This stretch was less attractive scenically and quite busy. The road surface quality varied between wonderfully newly paved at the beginning and awful, pothole-ridden, and bumpy in the middle section. The last good 10 kilometres into Sa Dec, the road was completely dug up for repaving, which was, of course, unpleasant for cycling.

Unfortunately, the ride continued in exactly the same way behind the city towards Vinh Long—but this road will certainly be excellent to ride in a year's time. The last kilometres before Vinh Long are already finished and went very quickly. We arrived just before 6 PM and took a room at the Nam Phuong, which is quite central but not located on the river. This hotel looked brand new, had freshly renovated rooms that were spacious and comfortable, and an lift, which is great for seven floors. The standard price for this quality of room in Vietnam is $15, and so it was here. We had dinner at Puong Thuy, the only restaurant in the centre located by the river, which doesn't make much of its great location as the decor is very uninspired. However, the food was good as expected, although the portions (25,000d per dish) could have been a bit more generous. There were decent spring rolls, fine beef with lemons, and grilled squid. The large grilled fish (90,000d) had wonderful meat and was filled with leeks—a tasty and inspired idea.

---

### Day 46 | 27.8. | 88 km  
**Vinh Long – Ben Tre – Mytho (– Saigon)**

In the morning, we took the ferry from the pier located about 3 kilometres east of the centre to the Ben Tre province. The first half of today's route was pure Delta idyll again, on the narrow, wonderfully rideable Road 57 through lush vegetation to Mo Cay, from where we then followed the well-maintained Highway 80 to the ferry to Ben Tre. The provincial capital is a strange place—so modern and well-maintained with excellent infrastructure that it doesn't really fit into this traditional area. Newly built, four-lane roads lead into the city, lined with equally new, chic houses. Ben Tre is an attractive town, but it doesn't exactly radiate Mekong Delta charm.

We had a good lunch here at the hotel restaurant Dong Khoi by the small lake in the centre. They had a very brief, ordinary English menu and a much better Vietnamese one, from which we ordered. The good thing about Vietnam is that, thanks to the Roman script, you can decode a menu even without knowing the language. The food here was good as expected: squid with lemongrass, grilled mussels, and beef with spinach in a light curry sauce. Standard prices between 30,000–40,000d for quite generous portions. After another ferry crossing, we reached Mytho, from where we boarded the bus to Saigon. That was very simple, quick, and cheap (18,000d + 5,000d for the bike), and it saved us having to cycle the boring, traffic-heavy stretch of Highway 1 again. From the bus station in Cholon, we cycled into the centre and checked back into the same room as in March, at the Huynh Anh Hotel for $15. For dinner, we again chose the tried-and-tested, and the Bo Tung Xeo certainly did not disappoint. A meal here is always an event, and the popularity of the place is still strong. The house speciality was superb again, and the fresh oysters (12,000d each) were huge. The beef salad (45,000d) was also delicious, and the marinated goat breast for self-grilling (45,000d) was great. After dinner, we got two plane tickets to Hué for tomorrow afternoon and drank the cheapest beer in the world, Bia Hoi, on the street in front of our hotel—3,500d per litre.

---

### Day 47 | 28.8. | 42 km  
**Saigon – Hué**

We had breakfast at the Café de l'Opera, an Italian place with Illy Espresso on the chic Lam Son Square. A very good, though not perfect, cappuccino cost 33,000d here, and they had tasty paninis with Parma ham and goat cheese (70,000d)—not exactly the Fresco in Phnom Penh, but probably one of the best breakfast options in Saigon. At 11:30 AM, after a rather long but successful bike repair, we checked out and cycled to the airport, which is very close to the city centre in Saigon. On the way, we had lunch at the Tib Restaurant, a very nice, upscale place in an old French villa, located in a quiet side street off the busy Hai Ba Trung Boulevard. You wouldn't expect such a beautiful restaurant in this less-charming part of Saigon, but it's definitely worth the trip. They mainly serve traditional, Royal Hué Cuisine, beautifully presented and tasting superb. The service is attentive, and the prices are still reasonable; no dish cost more than €5. The beef and prawn salad (85,000d), the raw fish salad with fine dips (90,000d), and the beef rolls in La Lot leaves tasted wonderful.

The flight with Vietnam Airlines went perfectly; the bicycles were checked in without any extra charge and arrived undamaged. After a good one-hour flight, we reached Hué punctually just after four and cycled the 13 kilometres on Highway 1 into the centre. Although we were quite satisfied with our room here in the spring, this time we chose the slightly more comfortable Binh Minh Sunrise Hotel with an lift and free internet. The room was a bit small but modern and very well-equipped with comfortable beds, a minibar, and even a small bathtub. It wouldn't have been worth the originally demanded $20, but for the discount price of $15, it was very acceptable. Precisely because Hué is known for its chic tourist restaurants with Royal Cuisine, we went to the simple, local Nha Hang Van Canh, nicely located by a small pond on Highway 1, about 200m south of the central roundabout, and deservedly very popular. They didn't have an English menu, but a waitress spoke a little English. The food was in the category of very cheap and very good; for €10, we drank eight bottles of beer and ate a grilled fish, duck with lemongrass, grilled squid, and beef with vegetables and pineapple.

---

### Day 48 | 29.8. | 166 km  
**Hué – Dong Hoi**

A very long but mostly flat and unremarkable day on Highway 1. We passed the demarcation line, leaving behind the most pleasant aspects of South Vietnam: the numerous, cosy roadside cafés and cold drinks from the fridge. The north of the country is visibly poorer, and the houses, restaurants, and shops along the way are simpler. The road, however, is in top condition and great for cycling. This part of the highway is called the "Route sans Joie", and a few years ago, this name would have been accurate for cyclists too, as the road was disastrously bad when we drove north from Hué back then. That's completely different now; only the scenery leaves a little to be desired.

An exception to this is the area around Dong Hoi, which is quite pretty, with dunes on the coast and the impressive mountain range toward Laos. The city itself is also beautifully situated at the mouth of the Nhat Le River with an endless dune beach right on its doorstep. Dong Hoi seems to be developing into a popular holiday resort for domestic tourists. The waterfront road is currently being expanded, and there are dozens of hotels and guesthouses, both on the river and on the beach. However, foreign tourists rarely stray here; the entire tourist infrastructure, with karaoke bars, countless simple beach restaurants, and rather unsightly hotel blocks, is clearly aimed at a Vietnamese audience. Given the huge offering, we naturally got a good, inexpensive room without difficulty. The only thing to complain about was the somewhat weak air conditioning; otherwise, our room at the fairly new "Ke Bang" right on the river offered the usual comfort and wide beds for a cheap €10. Since it was raining and we didn't want to look for a restaurant for long, we ate around the corner at the simple Nhu Y in the evening. It was well-attended and very cheap. A large pot of fine Vietnamese fish soup with pineapple cost just 20,000d. The grilled beef and the grilled squid (30,000d each) were also good, though not of outstanding quality.

---

### Day 49 | 30.8. | 162 km  
**Dong Hoi – Ha Tinh**

In the morning, I rode a few kilometres along the beautiful coastal road, past numerous hotels and beach restaurants, hoping to somehow reconnect with Highway 1 further north. However, this attempt ended either in the dunes or in dead ends, so I had to cycle back almost to Dong Hoi, where a paved side road brought me back to the highway. Today's route was scenically quite beautiful and mostly flat again. The only pass between us and Hanoi is now also history, as a new, short tunnel makes the mountain crossing at the Ngang Pass unnecessary. Shortly after, there is a beautiful, secluded beach where we had already stopped six years ago—the ideal spot for a refreshing swim in the midday heat. The next 10–15 kilometres were slightly hilly through a beautiful, quite isolated area. The rest of the route was then pancake-flat through the rice fields to Ha Tinh, a featureless provincial town on the highway that offered numerous accommodation options. We took a room at the somewhat aged Binh Minh Hotel. Here, there was an lift and a very spacious suite with a bathtub, separate shower cubicle, and two wide beds for a reasonable 300,000d. Only the carpet might need replacing; otherwise, the room was old-fashioned but well-maintained.

Since there was no restaurant in the immediate vicinity, we ate in our hotel's dining room. The menu here promised all sorts of wonderful dishes, of which, of course, very few were available. But what ended up on the table was quite good. Crispy Nem (15,000d), grilled squid (30,000d), frog legs with lemongrass (35,000d), and tender veal in rice paper (60,000d).

---

### Day 50 | 31.8. | 132 km  
**Ha Tinh – Vinh – Quynh Beach**

A rather unremarkable flat stage on a sometimes poor road surface, with a coffee break in Vinh, the largest city between Hué and Hanoi. It's a prime example of Soviet-style town planning with wide avenues and unappealing architecture. However, they have a handful of really chic, comfortable cafés here with excellent service and delicious fruit shakes. In the modest café culture of the north, such things are highly appreciated.

After almost 130 kilometres, a sign pointed to the "Quynh Beach Tourist Resort," which sounded quite promising. So, we turned off and rode about 5 kilometres on a paved but bumpy side road to the coast. Western tourists are almost certainly rare here; this area seems very poor and traditional. Ox carts drove up and down the dirty but picturesque beach, and there are a few very simple beach stalls and a slightly worn-out hotel, the Phuong Trung, which has seen better days. Nobody here speaks a word of English, and I had to look at three rooms until I found one where everything still worked reasonably well. The rooms weren't bad—simple but very clean with air-con—and for 150,000d you can't expect more. Dinner at the hotel was excellent in any event. The lightly breaded, butter-fried squid (35,000d) tasted superb, but the absolute highlight was the whole grilled fish we chose—a true specimen, at least five pounds heavy and with delicious, firm meat. In Europe, a nearly priceless feast, the cost here was just 100,000d.

### Day 51 | 1.9. | 161 km  
**Quynh Beach – Ninh Binh**

Back on Highway 1, it was 65 kilometres of mostly flat terrain again to Tanh Hoa, the capital of this quite poor province. In this area, almost all café and shop owners try to rip off the few Westerners who venture here. While you are usually treated honestly in South Vietnam, and at most pay a completely justified small "Farang surcharge" for things like Ca Phè or water, here in the north, they often demand double or even more than the realistic price and then get angry when you refuse to pay these extortionate prices. This makes stopping for breaks somewhat tedious, but of course, there are also nice, honest people now and then.

Behind Tanh Hoa, I then turned onto Highway 10, while Achim drove directly to Ninh Binh on the 1. The detour via Phat Diem was definitely worth it, as Highway 10 is a comfortable, lightly trafficked country road that leads through beautiful scenery and sleepy villages. Up to Phat Diem—a town with something of a tourist attraction, as one of Southeast Asia's largest and most beautiful cathedrals stands here—the road was excellent to ride with a good surface and little traffic. I almost felt a bit like I was in the Mekong Delta, except that people here are much more reserved. The remaining stretch into Ninh Binh was then quite bumpy and busy but still a welcome break from the annoying honking of buses and trucks on Highway 1.

Ninh Binh, due to its proximity to tourist attractions like Tam Coc, is the first place since Hué that also attracts some Western tourists. However, the quality of accommodation seemed poor; most hotels looked quite worn out. Accordingly, we did not object to being steered into the Than Tuy GH by one of the numerous touts. In the brand-new hotel building in the courtyard behind the simple guesthouse, there were good, modern rooms with air-con and a bathtub for a fair $15. What is more, the restaurant offered surprisingly good and authentic food; even goat meat and grilled liver were on the menu—hardly typical for a traveller spot. The prices were like a local Quan, but here they had a German menu.

---

### Day 52 | 2.9. | 93 km  
**Ninh Binh – Hanoi**

Since I had drunk a bottle of complimentary homemade spirits with some Danes at the hotel last night and went to bed very late, I didn't get on the bike until 10 AM this morning to cycle the rest of the way up to Hanoi. I felt absolutely miserable after yesterday's drinking, and it was a very hot, sunny day, so the normally comfortable, flat 90 kilometres were really hard work.

About 40 kilometres before Hanoi, a newly built motorway begins, so the route along the railway line on the old Highway 1 was relatively quiet. Even in Hanoi itself, the traffic was comparatively calm today, perhaps due to the national holiday and the heat. Since the Viet Anh Hotel, where we stayed in spring, was full, we took a room in the Anh Dao Hotel a few doors down. It doesn't have an lift, and the rooms are a bit older, but they are well-equipped with wooden floors and a bathtub. At $15 with breakfast and free internet, it was very inexpensive.

In the afternoon, we had a snack at the Cyclo Bar, perhaps the most uniquely decorated restaurant in Hanoi, where you sit very comfortably in chic surroundings on converted Cyclos. The quality of the food is alright, although the prices were perhaps somewhat on the high side. The marinated fish fillets in banana leaf (80,000d) were very well prepared, but the Tagliatelle Salad with raw beef (65,000d) was something of a misnomer. Not that it tasted bad, but the meat was fried. Furthermore, for this price, they could have used a cheese other than simple Gouda.

Dinner at Quan An Ngon was an event again. In addition to the already excellent appetizers, we ordered an extremely delicious mango-seafood salad (42,000d) and wonderfully marinated sautéed beef (45,000d).

---

### Day 53 | 3.9. | 133 km  
**Hanoi – Hung Yen – Thai Binh**

We first went for a decent breakfast in the morning at Café au Lac, which, to the best of my knowledge, still has the best coffee in Hanoi, although a double shot is always needed for a cappuccino. The food was also very good again, both the Salmon-Cream Cheese-Bagel (59,000d) and the Papaya Beef Salad (35,000d). We left Hanoi heading east over the Chuong D Bridge and first drove about 25 kilometres on the motorway towards Haiphong. This was very pleasant, as there is a separate cycle path next to the road on which you can ride quite undisturbed.

Then we turned onto the 39, until shortly after Hung Yen, a very good, lightly trafficked country road through rather boring, sprawling agricultural landscape. Out of Hung Yen, we accidentally took the wrong road, but after a few bumpy kilometres, it led back to the 39, whose quality, however, deteriorated sharply. The 40 kilometres to the junction with Highway 10 were horribly bumpy on a busy, narrow road—and to top it all off, we had a headwind. The last stretch into Thai Binh on Highway 10 then went very quickly on a good surface.

Thai Binh, a quite large provincial capital, is a place little visited by tourists with no special features. Only those travelling by bike or wanting to visit a completely untouristed provincial town off the beaten track land here. However, it was still worth spending the night here; where else do you get an extremely comfortable room in a 3-star hotel, impeccably maintained with carpet, minibar, designer shower, and sit-down bathtub for 180,000d? This Diamond Hotel is a real gem.

Since Thai Binh is hardly blessed with a large number of restaurants—unusual for a Vietnamese provincial town—we ate at the hotel's dining room again in the evening. The menu here is every vegetarian's and animal lover's nightmare. From turtle to rabbit to the regional speciality, cat, you could get everything here, relatively cheap and well-prepared. We initially ordered the quite unspectacular squid with shiitake and garlic (50,000d) and beef on a hot plate (50,000d), followed by grilled rabbit and cat with sesame from the wok (50,000d). My need for meat is definitely met for now; it's a good thing our destination tomorrow, Haiphong, is famous for its seafood.

---

### Day 54 | 4.9. | 85 km  
**Thai Binh – Haiphong**

This part of Highway 10 was very well developed and pleasant to ride, unremarkable and flat. The last kilometres into Haiphong again featured a cycle path next to Highway 5 almost to the centre. Since I had really liked Haiphong six years ago but only spent a few hours there, I made sure to arrive as early as possible and was there exactly at 11 AM. This left me with enough time for an extensive city exploration by bike, which is much less stressful in Haiphong than in other cities in the country. Despite its size—Haiphong is a city of a million people, the third-largest in the country—the place feels quite cosy, and the traffic is bearable. Haiphong has a beautiful, almost elegant Old Town with shady avenues, wide boulevards, and numerous well-preserved colonial-era buildings. Haiphong also has probably the highest café density in the country, some of them very chic and comfortable—a quite attractive port city that, strangely, still sees very few Western tourists, despite its favourable location near Halong Bay and the hydrofoil ferries to Cat Ba.

Gastronomically, Haiphong is said to be known for its seafood, and there are numerous restaurants in the city, but when we wanted to eat lunch, it was difficult to get anything other than the simplest standard dishes. We tried several places, all of which had great menus, but upon asking, rarely was more than chicken, beef, and squid available. When we were almost ready to give up, we finally found a nice place, the Nha Kach Hai Quan, a huge Bia Hoi pub in the garden of an old villa. Here, you eat cheaply and well in the typical Vietnamese style. They only had ten percent of the dishes in stock, but at least they had fried eel (30,000d), squid with fresh vegetables (30,000d), and a whole grilled fish—a thick one, wonderfully prepared for a very reasonable 90,000d.

We stayed at the same hotel as last time, the 4-star Huu Nghi, in a rather ugly but very centrally located building in the Old Town. Six years is a long time in Asia, and the hotel shows its age, a slightly run-down former First Class Hotel that has to sell its rooms off cheaply. But that's exactly what made the Huu Nghi a real bargain; the rooms may no longer be ultramodern and immaculately maintained, but they are still proper 4-star rooms with a bathtub, balcony, carpet, and nice furnishings. There is an lift, room service, a fruit platter, and porter service—none of it perfect, but you only pay $35 with breakfast here.

The Maxim's diagonally opposite the hotel, a quite chic, comfortable live music club with a restaurant, proved two things: 1. that you sometimes eat rather badly in Vietnam, and 2. that good ingredients don't make good food. Fast food cuisine in a Vietnamese style, served almost flavourlessly—a shame about the scallops, the squid, and the crisp vegetables. Much too expensive for what was offered, too. The Dai Thung Restaurant proved it can be done differently. Located in a narrow Old Town alley, it looked like a simple Quan from the outside but turned out to be a very chic, popular seafood restaurant on several levels with attractively designed interior and excellent, reasonably priced cuisine for the quality. I actually wasn't hungry anymore, but the raw beef salad (45,000d) and the fried elephant ear fish with ginger (70,000d) were so delicious that I couldn't resist.

### Day 55 | 5.9. | 43 km  
**Haiphong – Cat Ba**

A one-hour ride on the fast Hydrofoil ferry (100,000d + 30,000d for the bike) brought us to Cat Ba. As we sailed into the harbour, I could hardly believe my eyes. The town looks a bit like a miniature version of Hong Kong from afar, with dozens of multi-story, narrow buildings standing right on the steep, green slopes. It's a rather impressive sight, even if not very aesthetic. While only a handful of newly built hotels stood here in 2000, Cat Ba Town is now a proper holiday resort with capacity for mass tourism. However, the location of the place is truly fantastic, and the harbour is incredibly picturesque.

Currently, however, Cat Ba feels more like a Mediterranean resort in winter; it's almost alarmingly quiet after the holidays ended last week. The restaurants and cafés are empty, hotel rooms are available for a fraction of the cost, and even on the beaches Cat Co 1–3, there were only a handful of Western tourists. In this state, the notorious karaoke hell that is Cat Ba Town is very pleasant and easy to take. The island is truly stunningly beautiful, and still very unspoiled outside the city. Even Cat Co 2, the most beautiful of the three beaches connected by a spectacular plank path along sheer rocks, is still almost undeveloped; only two simple beach bars with huts stand here—a wonderful place for swimming. Cat Co 1 is less attractive and heavily developed. On tiny Cat Co 3, there is a new, very beautiful and subtly built luxury resort with a fantastic beach bar, where even non-guests can have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere at surprisingly reasonable prices.

After exploring the beaches, we returned to the deserted harbour promenade and ate delicious, homemade spring rolls at Noble House, the cosiest restaurant in the area—more of a traveller café, and thus a rarity in the Cat Ba scene, which is heavily geared towards domestic tourism. Since I wanted to see more of the island, and there was nothing to do in Cat Ba Town anyway, I got on the bike in the afternoon and rode a good 30-kilometre loop, first along the west coast, then over a small pass into the island's interior, and back on the main island road. Despite its rugged topography and numerous hills, Cat Ba is wonderfully suited for cycling. The main roads are in good condition and lightly trafficked, and scenically, I was reminded of Hawaii and Fiji as I rode along the spectacular coastal road.

We had dinner in a lovely setting at the Vosu Restaurant of the Sunrise Resort on Cat Co 3. The views from here are priceless, and while the food wasn't quite as spectacular, it was at least tasty and affordable. The Pasta Alamer (70,000d) tasted like it was in Italy, with the difference that there was at least three times the amount of seafood in it. Overall, the quality and quantity of the seafood offered were excellent, both in the salad (65,000d), from the wok with vegetables (75,000d), and the fried calamari (75,000d). The preparation (rather Mediterranean-influenced) was also very decent.

We stayed at the Van Anh Hotel, in the most central promenade location in the first row. Had I known that nothing was going on here, I wouldn't have taken the first room I saw, but it had an lift and a fantastic sea view, which alone was worth the $12. The room itself was decent, bright, and spacious, but the air conditioning was weak, and the bathtub was unusable.

### Day 56 | 6.9. | 61 km  
**Cat Ba – Halong City – Haiphong**

To return to the mainland, we chartered a private boat for the day to take us through Halong Bay. This is still relatively inexpensive here (€40) and has the advantage that you can decide the length of the trip and the stops yourself. Since this wasn't our first Halong cruise, we skipped visiting the grottoes and simply had the boat leisurely cruise us through the fabulous island landscape, with two swimming breaks at the small white-sand dream beaches in the bay.

In Halong Bay, tourist activity was virtually non-existent; the car parks near the grottoes were empty. During the hours-long journey, we only encountered two other tourist boats as we glided through the emerald-green water, and it truly felt like we had the bay all to ourselves.

We arrived at Halong City around noon and had two alternatives for the route back to Hanoi. We chose the route via Haiphong—60 kilometres today, about 100 kilometres tomorrow—which fit our schedule well. We first had to take the ferry from Hon Gai to Bai Chay, as the bridge connecting the two parts of Halong City is not yet completely finished. In Bai Chay, nearly a dozen 4-star hotel blocks now line the coast, and the formerly unattractive beach looks almost tropically beautiful after being artificially filled in. However, the tourism here is clearly aimed at domestic and other Asian tourists; in other words, you won't find peace or aesthetic charm here.

Both Highway 18 toward Hanoi and Highway 10 into Haiphong were very good for cycling, partly slightly hilly but almost consistently with new pavement. We reached Haiphong via the new, over one-kilometre-long Binh Bridge and again took a room in one of the hotels on Dien Bien Phu, but this time a cheaper one at the Kim Tanh Hotel. Annoyingly, hotels in Haiphong still openly operate a two-tiered pricing system for Vietnamese and foreigners, and the Kim Tanh was the only place where we got the room, or rather the Deluxe Suite, at the Vietnamese price of 350,000d. This was money well spent for a very comfortable, spacious room—immaculately maintained and very well-equipped, almost 4-star standard; only an lift and a balcony were missing.

We had dinner again around the corner at Dai Thung, where the beef salad tasted absolutely delicious once more.

### Day 57 | 7.9. | 104 km  
**Haiphong – Hanoi**

On the 100-kilometre, flat stretch from Haiphong to the capital, there is actually a continuous, mostly separate cycle path next to the highway. Now, this is Vietnam, which means you always have to expect oncoming motorbikes or trucks blocking the way, but for the most part, it was quite pleasant to ride, although the route itself isn't particularly interesting.

We were very lucky with accommodation in Hanoi. The Sunshine 2 Hotel on Ma May was opening today, and we got a special offer. The best room in the house—very comfortable and spacious by Hanoi standards, with a balcony, wooden floor, and a computer with fast internet access in the room—for $20. This price also included breakfast, and we could stay until the afternoon on Saturday. A superb deal! The hotel has an lift and an excellent bathroom with a huge shower.

We had a set menu and a cheese plate at Café des Arts and a light dinner at La Place Café.

## Hanoi Cafés & Restaurants

### Café des Arts
We had visited this stylishly furnished brasserie—with art on the walls and a comfortable sofa on the first floor—six years ago, but only for cocktails. The food here is very expensive, and we wanted to see if the hefty prices were justified. We ordered the cheapest set menu together for $10. For starters, there was a simple country paté with excellent rustic bread, the main course was calf's head with rice and vegetables, and for dessert, a Crème Brulée that was a bit too firm in consistency. Simple French comfort food, quite tasty, but still too expensive. The beautiful ambience and good, but not exceptional, food do not justify such exorbitant prices.

### Café La Place
A very nice little café in a prime location on the Cathedral Square, with charming retro decor, including an orange espresso machine from the 70s with matching orange lamps over the bar. The espresso here is good, as is the simple Asian and Western bistro food. Prices are quite moderate by Hanoi standards (the eggplant and mushroom stew in a clay pot cost 35,000d). They could still work a little on the cappuccino, though. Cinnamon really doesn't belong on it.

### Diva Café
Located right next to the Café au Lac, the Diva is also a slightly more upscale café with seating in the courtyard in front of an old colonial villa. The Vietnamese bistro cuisine, featuring the usual suspects, is quite decent. Salads cost around 40,000d, but the portions are rather small. However, since the coffee here is significantly worse than next door and also more expensive, the Diva is not an alternative to the Café au Lac.

### Bobby Chinn
Hanoi's ultimate restaurant offers modern international cuisine in a comfortable, stylish, yet unpretentious setting. The menu isn't extensive but includes interesting creations with influences from all over the world. At lunchtime, some of the dishes are $2–$3 cheaper, but the prices are reasonable anyway given the quality and ambience—and the portions are certainly not Nouvelle Cuisine. As hors d'oeuvres, we had beetroot salad with wonderful goat cheese in a walnut crust ($6) and Foie Gras in rice paper with caramelized apples ($15). Both tasted flawless, as did the main courses: chicken with gnocchi, spinach, and pine nuts ($10) and the Arabian Mezze ($10) with pita. But at Bobby Chinn, you don't just eat excellently; you can also relax wonderfully in the super-cosy, dark lounge, smoke shisha ($3), or drink cocktails—and this overall concept is what makes this restaurant so unique.

### Tamarind Café
This beautiful, highly praised vegetarian restaurant unfortunately did not deliver what the excellent, interesting menu promised. While they have really good juices and yogurt-fruit shakes, and the decor is very pleasant—colourful and comfortable—the dishes we ordered really didn't impress me. The Oriental skewers with grilled vegetables ($3.10) were served with a very fine chickpea-peanut sauce, but the vegetables were too dry and not seasoned enough. The Malay Quesadillas ($5.30) lacked the right kick and tasted a little bland. A real shame, as the concept is very good.

### Red Beer
Hanoi's most famous beer pub. A microbrewery that brews two different types of beer: a dark, Belgian-style one (Red Beer) and a German, Pilsner-style one. A large glass (650 ml) of draught costs 30,000d or 22,000d, which is a lot of money for a beer in Vietnam, but it must be said that the quality of the brew here is miles above the ordinary, cheap Bia Hoi—even I can tell that as a non-beer specialist. Surprisingly, you can also eat excellently and relatively cheaply at Red Beer for the area. The extensive menu offers pub food Vietnamese-style and a few Western dishes. The Vietnamese dishes were all authentic, tasty, and freshly prepared. Crispy spring rolls (30,000d), green papaya salad with dried beef (30,000d), and clams with chilli and lemongrass (40,000d).

### Pane e Vino
A minimalist but stylishly furnished Italian spot—café, enoteca, and restaurant. Here you can sit wonderfully at the counter next to the designer espresso machine, admire the old film posters on the walls, and drink your breakfast cappuccino, which, while not cheap ($2), is expertly prepared; perhaps the best in the city. The owner is a real Italian and seems to know a lot about gastronomy. The menu offers an excellent selection of dishes, although they are quite expensive even by Hanoi standards. However, the quality seems to be high. We only had two small items for breakfast here, but the Parma ham on the bruschetta ($3) was excellent, as was the original Pecorino served with the walnut salad ($5).

### Green Tangerine
We had already eaten very well here in the spring. The French chef is excellent at his craft and offers fresh, creative fusion cuisine that is certainly among the best Hanoi has to offer culinarily. The portions are generous, the à la carte prices are absolutely fair, and the lunch menu for 95,000d is a real bargain. Today we opted for the beef carpaccio with garlic-roasted potatoes and, for dessert, the mango-passion fruit cheesecake. Also outstanding in taste and beautifully presented were the two à la carte dishes we ordered: the goat cheese mousse with pistachio pastry ($6.70) and the delicious, very generously portioned tuna tartare with tagliatelle ($12.50).

### Old Hanoi Café
After walking past this truly pretty, inviting Old Quarter café on Ma May countless times, we finally managed to try the Old Hanoi shortly before heading to the airport. Like the long-established Little Hanoi, it's an ideal place for a quick snack or to rest a bit after a 'shopping spree' or city exploration. You sit on comfortable wicker chairs or sofas in a classic, beautiful interior, and the food is very good, which it should be, as they also offer cooking classes here. There is a good selection of classic Vietnamese bistro cuisine at the usual (now quite high) Old Quarter café prices. The spring rolls (35,000d) were homemade and freshly prepared, and the Cha Ca (59,000d) was even truly excellent—the best I've had so far—served with rice paper and fresh vegetables for wrapping, plus a very fine dip with dill instead of the authentic but awful shrimp paste sauce.
