### 12 April 2007 — Tehran

**Arrival from Bangkok**

The flight from Bangkok arrived in Tehran around midday, but it took ages for my seven-day visa on arrival to be issued. Not because the procedure was complicated — it was just one form to fill in and US$50 to pay — but because a group of Azerbaijanis were ahead of me in the queue.

Just before two o’clock, I could finally get back on my bike.

The route from the airport into Tehran is well signposted, but surprisingly long — about 50 kilometres; via the motorway it would have been shorter — and not a pleasant ride. The roads are decent enough, but the traffic is already chaotic some 30 kilometres before the centre. It wasn’t just the sheer number of vehicles (petrol is practically free here), but also the complete disregard for any traffic rules.

It was tricky riding, and I worked up a real sweat despite mild spring temperatures.

By the time I reached the main railway station, all I wanted was to escape this megacity of fifteen million people, millions of cars, and air that must rank among the most polluted in the world.

On the spur of the moment, I decided to take the night train to Yazd — a quiet, old desert town, and exactly the right place to properly arrive in the country. The night train doesn’t normally carry bicycles, but they made an exception for me because I’m a tourist.
