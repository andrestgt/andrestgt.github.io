Iran
12.04–19.04.2007 

12.04.2007
The flight from Bangkok arrived in Tehran around midday, but it took ages for my seven-day visa on arrival to be issued. Not because the procedure was complicated — it was just one form to fill in and US$50 to pay — but because a group of Azerbaijanis were ahead of me in the queue. Just before two o’clock, I could finally get back on my bike.
The route from the airport into Tehran is well signposted, but surprisingly long (about 50 km; via the motorway it would have been shorter) and not a pleasant ride. The roads are decent enough, but the traffic is already chaotic some 30 km before the centre. It wasn’t just the sheer number of vehicles (petrol is practically free here), but also the complete disregard for any traffic rules. It was tricky riding, and I worked up a real sweat despite mild spring temperatures.
By the time I reached the main railway station, all I wanted was to escape this 15-million-strong megacity of 15 million people, millions of cars, and air that must rank among the most polluted in the world. On the spur of the moment I decided to take the night train to Yazd, which is meant to be a quiet, old desert town — exactly the right place to properly arrive in the country. The night train doesn’t normally carry bicycles, but they made an exception for me because I’m a tourist. I didn’t even have to pay anything extra.
In fact, the service at Tehran’s main station was excellent. An English-speaking railway employee took care of everything — ticket, luggage arrangements — and again, free of charge. I left my things in the left-luggage office and spent the hours before departure with a Qalyan (Farsi for a waterpipe), Chai and dates (3,000 T) in the traditional, pleasantly furnished Azari Teahouse near the station — exactly the way I’d hoped my time in Iran would begin. Before the train finally left at 21:30, I took a short stroll around the neighbourhood. Opposite the station there are a few shops selling delicious freshly squeezed fruit juices for 50 cents a glass.
The train was an old Spanish one — probably from the 1970s. The compartments in the first-class sleeper (the only class available) were a little cramped, but the beds were reasonably comfortable given the circumstances, with fresh bedding. The eight-hour sleeper ride cost me less than US$4. I slept straight through until half past five, when the sun came up — desert all around.

The train reached Yazd around 6 a.m. The station was some two kilometres from the centre. It was Friday, and at that hour the streets were completely deserted — and, to be honest, they didn’t really get much livelier as the day went on. Yazd’s old town on a Friday is like a museum: an old desert city of mud bricks, pale brown, crumbling, and seemingly lifeless — fascinating. I cycled through a labyrinth of empty alleys, looked at the distinctive architectural sights, and by about half past nine I’d already covered the entire old town.
Time for a pot of Chai and some pastries in stylish surroundings. The atmospheric courtyard of Malek-o-Tojjar was perfect for that — a traditional hotel hidden deep inside the deserted bazaar.
By 11 o’clock I’d pretty much done everything I’d planned to see that day, and a city without people isn’t exactly ideal for soaking up a different culture or for people-watching, so I headed to the bus terminal and checked my options. The next bus to Shiraz left at 14:00. That suited me: enough time for lunch at Yazd’s most unusual restaurant, Hamam-e-Khan — a restored former hammam in an underground vaulted space. At the same time, as a popular family outing spot, it was the liveliest place in town. The food was very decent and not too expensive; besides the usual kebabs there was a bit more variety on the menu, such as an aubergine starter and chicken Fesenjun (3,200 T). This is an incredibly intense sauce, slightly challenging at first, made from pomegranates, walnuts and cardamom, and it tastes fantastic when mixed with yoghurt.
The bus ride to Shiraz, in a modern, comfortable Volvo, took seven hours. Just as with the train, bus fares are minimal. I paid 4,000 T for the trip; the bike came with a small, negotiable surcharge, but that was fine.
The route was beautiful: over mountain ranges and across endless desert plains. I’d originally planned to travel at night as much as possible to save time and money, but I’m glad I did this one in daylight.
In Shiraz I took a room at Sasan Hotel, centrally located not far from Zand Boulevard. Since foreigners in Iran always have to pay more for hotel rooms than locals — entirely official and apparently legal — accommodation is the only real budget strain on a trip through the country. Still, bargaining is very much possible. My room here in Shiraz was small, but clean and fairly comfortable, with a double bed, carpet, and its own bathroom with a Western toilet (apparently not a given in cheaper Iranian hotels). I paid US$15, which seemed fair to me — especially as the manager was very friendly and helpful (and talked your ear off).

A rainy, grey morning — far from a lovely spring day — so I slept in and then wandered at leisure through the wonderful covered bazaar, with shops and vaulted ceilings straight out of One Thousand and One Nights. The courtyard of the caravanserai, planted with orange trees, and the traditional teahouse next door completed the picture of this architectural gem.
By midday it was still raining, so there was little point in setting off to explore the city, especially as Shiraz’s sights are spread out over quite a distance.
So the hotel organised a driver for 15,000 T to take me to the ruins of Persepolis, about 50 km north-east of Shiraz. And sure enough: the moment I got there, the sun came out and lit up the impressive reliefs of the 2,500-year-old ruined city. My first impression of Persepolis was a slight disappointment, though. It’s not a place that awes you with sheer visual splendour, so comparisons with Angkor or the Colosseum are laughable (the Lonely Planet author got carried away and set expectations unnecessarily high). The longer I wandered among the columns and along the walls, and enjoyed the views from the tombs carved into the rock on the hillside, the more this place began to fascinate me. It has a subtle pull, not a spectacular one. It was also wonderful that there were no tour groups rampaging about, and I could stroll through the ruins almost on my own.
Even more visually dramatic than Persepolis were the four rock-cut tombs of Naqsh-e Rostam, carved into an imposing ridge — their reliefs and the theatrical setting look as if they’ve been lifted straight out of an Indiana Jones film.
Back in Shiraz it was still raining, but there’s always tomorrow.
Dinner was a surreal highlight — one of those special experiences you don’t forget. Yord Restaurant lies a few kilometres outside the city at the end of a potholed track and is almost impossible to find; even my taxi driver got lost several times. The moment you step through the carpeted entrance into the huge yurt, you’re in another world. An old man played traditional music, a woman in traditional dress baked bread over an open fire, and in the middle of the tent the warming flames of the fireplace flickered. Pure steppe romance — and not a trace of kitsch. Yord isn’t a tourist place; it’s more of a rural retreat for the urban middle and upper classes. You can simply lounge on cushions with Qalyan, cake and Chai, but the food is excellent too. I had the best and most generous kebabs of the whole trip there, plus an extensive salad and dessert buffet you could help yourself to. This sensational, unforgettable experience cost only €10 and was worth every rial.

In the morning the sun shone through the window — warm spring air and blue sky instantly made Shiraz far more appealing. I got back in the saddle and went sightseeing. Shiraz may be a large city with heavy traffic and no compact, picture-postcard centre, but it’s a pleasant place, with plenty of splendid parks, palaces and mosques — and, not least, that wonderful bazaar — to keep you busy for a good few days. So it’s no surprise that Shiraz is fairly touristy.
My favourite place in the city was the fantastic teahouse in a green courtyard at the Hafez mausoleum complex. I spent the whole afternoon and evening there with Qalyan, tea and Faludeh. If I’d stayed longer in Shiraz, I’d have gone every day. Despite the occasional small tour group stopping by, it’s a wonderful place to chat with English-speaking locals, watch the habits of Iran’s big-city crowd — and even flirt (besides smoking Qalyan, that seems to be the main pastime of young Iranians, regardless of gender).
Food-wise, the day was — once again — dominated by the inevitable kebabs. Lunch was a lamb fillet kebab (6,900 T) at upmarket Shatter Abbas, curiously popular with Shiraz’s middle class. It was decent, but it was overpriced — and I wouldn’t swear an oath that the meat actually was fillet.
In the evening I had a juicy, deliciously marinated chicken kebab at simple Haji Baba on Zand Boulevard. It tasted at least as good and was far cheaper (2,200 T). The service was poor, but so what?
At 23:00 I took the night bus to Isfahan (4,000 T), arriving seven hours later.

16.04.2007
I cycled a little over five kilometres from the bus terminal into the centre, where the main boulevard even had a cycle lane, and then spent two hours trying to find a decent room. Every hotel recommended in the guidebook either no longer existed or had raised prices dramatically without improving the standard at all. In the end I found a room that was worth the money: a new, centrally located place with the idiotic name “Tourist Hotel”. It wasn’t cheap (US$30, non-negotiable), but it was good value — in other words, a large, comfortable three-star room with a king-size bed and a faux-marble bathroom. Money well spent, especially as hotel checkout in Iran is at 14:00, which meant I could use the room for 30 hours.
After a wonderful shower I set off straight away to explore the city: cycling through kilometres of parkland along the river, crossing to the other bank over picturesque historic bridges, circling the world-famous Imam Square with its breathtaking architecture, and then stopping for tea and pastries (1,000 T) at Qaysarieh teahouse, whose veranda offers superb views over the square.
Isfahan exceeded all expectations. This city is a traveller’s dream: well kept, green, picturesque, relaxed — simply perfect.
For lunch I went to Sharzad, one of the city’s most elegant places, with an opulent dining hall — unfortunately occupied at the time by a Japanese tour group being speed fed. The food was decent and not too expensive, but the service was very poor. I ordered the local speciality Esfahani Biriani (2,100 T), a very filling dish — a sort of meat-and-vegetable patty in flatbread, with pieces of bread dipped in yoghurt and tomato sauce.
After that meal I needed a midday nap — handy that my hotel was directly opposite — before heading back to Imam Square for sunset. Lit up, the square looked even more magical.
Dinner at Bastani Traditional Restaurant in the arcades of Imam Square was good — not cheap, but the service was attentive, and for a small surcharge you could dine traditionally on carpets and cushions. I ordered a very fine chicken Fesenjun (5,000 T) and a classic vegetable khoresht (2,400 T). For once, no kebabs today!

17.04.2007
After a long morning walk through the bazaar to the beautiful Jameh Mosque and back to Imam Square — with another stop for Chai and pastries at the teahouse — I’d essentially finished my sightseeing programme in Isfahan. So I could simply drift through the day and enjoy the city’s atmosphere. Isfahan’s bazaar isn’t nearly as beautiful and atmospheric as Shiraz’s, but the riverside parks more than make up for it. I spent most of the afternoon on the grass by the Si-o Seh Bridge, reading my book or watching people go by.
Lunch was chicken kebab and yoghurt again — nicely marinated and cheap (2,000 T) — at simple Restaurant-e Sa’adi on Chahar Bagh Abbasi.
In the evening I went for another ride along the river — Isfahan is a wonderful city for cycling — followed by a short walk through Jolfa, Isfahan’s neat, charming Armenian Christian quarter, where the city’s modern cafés can be found and the boldest outfits are on display.
Then it was back to Tehran by night bus, this time in one of those genuinely funky 1960s Mercedes buses that cost almost nothing (1,800 T). I only realised too late that at that price I could have bought two tickets and travelled in ridiculous comfort. Oh well — next time!

18.04.2007
On my first day I found Tehran absolutely dreadful — and even today, after getting off the bus at 6 a.m. on some random corner of this enormous monstrosity of a city and spending three hours trying (1) not to be run over and (2) to find an acceptable room at an acceptable price, I still couldn’t claim I’d developed any positive feelings for the city.
As far as hotels were concerned, it was the same problem as in Isfahan: far more expensive than the guidebook described, with value that simply didn’t add up. US$15 for a tiny, musty room with a squat toilet is simply unacceptable. But in Tehran too I ended up finding a slightly more expensive room that was worth its US$25 including breakfast. Hotel Paresto was in a quiet side street and very well kept. My single room was small but smart — clean and modern, with a fridge and TV. The location wasn’t bad either, though you can’t really speak of a “centre” in Tehran. The metro was a ten-minute walk away.
Despite the chaotic traffic — or perhaps because of it — a bicycle isn’t a bad way to explore Tehran. I started by heading down to the large Park-e Shahr and the opulent Golestan Palace next door. Yes, even in the chaos and smog of south Tehran there are a few pleasant corners. The enormous bazaar, however, is only interesting for shopping; architecturally it has nothing to offer.
After a stroll through the bazaar I cycled almost 20 km steadily uphill to north Tehran, towards the slopes of the snow-capped Alborz Mountains. This part of the city is a different world — a modern metropolis with chic shopping malls, expensive restaurants and European-style cafés; there are green avenues, great views, and the traffic isn’t as heavy. Much of it was built in recent decades with practicality in mind so that there aren’t any real sights — but it’s by far the city’s most pleasant and modern neighbourhood.
While I was sitting with a cappuccino at Café de France, a young Iranian woman even joined me and we chatted for a while about the situation in the country. Contrary to the perception widely held in the West, Iran — despite the power of the mullahs — is not a place where only bearded fundamentalists and black tents roam about. Quite the opposite: most young people wear jeans and trainers; the boys often have gelled, 1980s Dave Gahan tribute haircuts and tight T-shirts. You rarely see fully veiled women, not just here, but even in the smaller cities. More often they wear a fashionable, close-fitting coat, jeans, lots of make-up, and the headscarf only covers the back of the head so as to show off as much of the hairstyle as possible. At times it also seemed as if every second young Iranian woman had a plaster on her nose — cosmetic surgery appears to be the latest craze here.
I also found it interesting that I was taken for a local almost everywhere and was often addressed in Farsi, which gave me a terrible guilty conscience because I didn’t understand a word. But it had one clear advantage: unless someone wanted to know the way or the time, I could move about completely unbothered and didn’t stand out as a tourist in the crowd.
After my tour of the north of the city, I ate a tasty Dizi (lamb stew) in the pleasant Iranian Traditional Restaurant, and before dinner I went for Qalyan, dates and Chai at Sofre Khane Ayyaram — a traditional teahouse and meeting place for Tehran’s young middle class — where I was treated extremely courteously, especially once it became apparent that I was a tourist.
And then — would you believe it — that evening, travelling to dinner on Tehran’s modern metro, I realised Tehran had grown on me. Even if the city is ugly, stressful and polluted, a visit to Tehran is an essential part of a trip to Iran. It’s the pulsating heart of modern Iran; it’s also where you meet the most people you can talk to thanks to their good English. If Isfahan and Persepolis represent the past, then Tehran stands for the country’s present — with all its downsides and upsides.
Dinner at Khayyam Restaurant was a fitting end to my week in Iran. Surely one of the most beautiful traditional restaurants in the country, set in a vaulted space and richly decorated with pools, carpets and cushion seating, it served wonderfully juicy lamb and chicken kebabs (Bakhtyeri Kebab, 5,500 T) with yoghurt, fresh herbs and grilled tomatoes.
€1 = US$1.34 = 1,100 T = 11,000 rial
